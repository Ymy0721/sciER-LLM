He lists Cassel brown, vermilion, emerald green, Naples yellow, green earth, dark chrome yellow, Prussian blue, burnt Sienna, yellow ochre, raw umber, and zinc yellow. In addition, he includes more general references to “straw yellow,” “red brown,” “black,” “raw Italian earth,” “dark white,” “yellow and red lacquer,” “white,” “light chrome,” “cadmium” and “cobalt,” giving no indication of color for the latter two species. “Cadmium” could be cadmium red or yellow and “cobalt” could mean cobalt blue, violet or yellow. The inclusion of additional pigments in this note suggests that it may have been written after the 1940 Arte Italiana Contemporanea.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"pigment combinations\": \"Reactant\", \"specific elements of a composition\": \"Reactant\", \"shadows\": \"Reactant\", \"mountains\": \"Reactant\", \"flesh\": \"Reactant\", \"Cassel brown\": \"Inorganic\", \"vermilion\": \"Inorganic\", \"emerald green\": \"Inorganic\", \"Naples yellow\": \"Inorganic\", \"green earth\": \"Inorganic\", \"dark chrome yellow\": \"Inorganic\", \"Prussian blue\": \"Inorganic\", \"burnt Sienna\": \"Inorganic\", \"yellow ochre\": \"Inorganic\", \"raw umber\": \"Inorganic\", \"zinc yellow\": \"Inorganic\", \"straw yellow\": \"Inorganic\", \"red brown\": \"Inorganic\", \"black\": \"Inorganic\", \"raw Italian earth\": \"Inorganic\", \"dark white\": \"Inorganic\", \"yellow and red lacquer\": \"Inorganic\", \"white\": \"Inorganic\", \"light chrome\": \"Inorganic\", \"cadmium\": \"Inorganic\", \"cobalt\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {}} "}

This was probably due to the systemic properties of SFX that has been seemingly acting with a translaminar activity in this case of the prickly pear cactus since it is a CAM plant. Moreover, initial residues concentrations were higher for the treatment with SFX alone in comparison with those for the treatment with SFX + MO. In fact, in the latter case, the insecticide solution is a mixture of the two ingredients which subsequently decreased the amount of SFX molecules in the droplets volume.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"SFX\": \"Reactant\", \"residues concentrations\": \"Condition\", \"treatments\": \"Condition\", \"fruits and cladodes\": \"Reactant\", \"prickly pear cactus\": \"Organic\", \"CAM plant\": \"Organic\", \"insecticide solution\": \"Solution\", \"droplets volume\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<SFX,residues concentrations>\": \"Created by\", \"<SFX,treatments>\": \"Used in\", \"<insecticide solution,droplets volume>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The size distribution was obtained after sulphurisation of two good samples that were dip-coated at 80 °C, and confirms that large domains were obtained by our method, with a modal range of 15–50 μm and several single crystals exceeding 50 μm. The largest crystals had diameters of ~100 μm (see Fig. 1(a)) and provided evidence of large-scale growth. At deposition temperatures below 50 °C and above 80 °C, the precursor did not sufficiently cover the substrate. This resulted in poor sulphurisation and a lack of good-quality domains. It is unclear why high-temperature dip-coating was ineffective. It is possible that the kinetic energy of precursor molecules was greater than the adsorption energy at temperatures near the water boiling point leading to desorption. There might have also been a complementary effect from re-dissolution of the precursor at elevated temperatures.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"sulphurisation\": \"Reaction\", \"precursor\": \"Reactant\", \"temperatures\": \"Condition\", \"water boiling point\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<sulphurisation,precursor>\": \"Created from\", \"<sulphurisation,temperatures>\": \"Along with\", \"<precursor,water boiling point>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Costa et al.  demonstrated that this percentage has effects on the pulp thermal properties (Table 2). However, its effect on the temperature profile is quite low and therefore negligible in the anthocyanin degradation. Figure 3c shows the effect of the heat exchange temperature, and as expected, the higher its value, the higher the degradation rate. Finally, Fig. 3d illustrates that increasing the pipe length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) causes an increase in the degradation rate. Even so, for these last two cases, considering the upper limit values (T∞ = 100 °C and L/D = 3000), the loss of anthocyanin does not reach 1%, allowing to infer that this microconstituent presents an optimal thermal stability in the açaí pulp.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"açaí pulp\": \"Reactant\", \"anthocyanin\": \"Reactant\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"heat exchange temperature\": \"Condition\", \"pipe length-to-diameter ratio\": \"Condition\", \"thermal properties\": \"Condition\", \"degradation rate\": \"Reaction\", \"thermal stability\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<anthocyanin,açaí pulp>\": \"Created from\", \"<degradation rate,temperature>\": \"Created by\", \"<degradation rate,heat exchange temperature>\": \"Created by\", \"<degradation rate,pipe length-to-diameter ratio>\": \"Created by\", \"<thermal stability,açaí pulp>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

As the DFT-calculated ν(O–O) frequency matches experiment for O2 on some metals, such as Pt(111), the deviations are most likely due to the presence of oxides in experiment on stronger binding metals52. Bond-order conservation53 rules and back donation of metal’s d-electrons to antibonding O2 orbitals54 both suggest that the ν(O–O) stretch should decrease with increasing ν⊥(M–O2) stretch8, 27. Thus, our DFT calculations and scaling experimental data support that the 500–800 cm−1 frequencies belong to frustrated rotations and that 600–1000 cm−1 frequencies observed experimentally are not purely due to an O–O stretching mode.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ν(O–O) stretch\": \"Reactant\", \"ν⊥(M–O) stretch\": \"Reactant\", \"O2\": \"Reactant\", \"Pt(111)\": \"Inorganic\", \"oxides\": \"Inorganic\", \"metal's d-electrons\": \"Inorganic\", \"frustrated rotations\": \"Reaction\", \"O–O stretching mode\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ν(O–O) stretch,ν⊥(M–O) stretch>\": \"Created from\", \"<O2,Pt(111)>\": \"Used in\", \"<oxides,metal's d-electrons>\": \"Created by\", \"<frustrated rotations,O–O stretching mode>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), and is widely used in the food, medicine, and agricultural industries. Nisin shows broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. It is believed to adsorb to the cell membranes of bacteria, disrupt them, and cause internal cellular substances to be released, thereby promoting cell death2,3. Under acidic conditions (pH < 6.0), nisin displays desirable solubility and stability with only a slight loss of activity after heat treatment4,5. However, the structure of nisin changes under alkaline conditions due to an intermolecular nucleophilic addition reaction, which results in decreased water-solubility, thermal stability, and antibacterial activity6,7. Thus, the industrial application of nisin as a natural antimicrobial is currently limited to acidic conditions.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Nisin\": \"Reactant\", \"Lactococcus lactis subspecies strain\": \"Reactant\", \"acidic conditions\": \"Condition\", \"alkaline conditions\": \"Condition\", \"intermolecular nucleophilic addition reaction\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Nisin,Lactococcus lactis subspecies strain>\": \"Created from\", \"<Nisin,acidic conditions>\": \"Used in\", \"<Nisin,alkaline conditions>\": \"Used in\", \"<Nisin,intermolecular nucleophilic addition reaction>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Several methods have been developed to overcome these limitations by increasing the surface/volume ratio15–17. Among the known microporous materials, nanosized CHA zeolites are attractive candidates as they are composed of discrete nanoparticles (single crystals), giving rise to a higher external surface area and greater availability of active sites compared to the micron-sized CHA15,16,18,19. Recently, we reported on the CO2 single-gas adsorption behavior of nanosized CHA samples with a particle size of 60 nm and a Si/Al ratio of 2.2 with different alkali-metal cations by combining classical modeling, experimental adsorption measurements, and in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy9.

Sep-Pak® cartridges with C18 hydrophobic reversed phase retain non-polar compounds and particles (Straub et al. 2018; Ramirez et al. 2000). Colloidal TcO2 is also retained on the Sep-Pak® and we hypothesised that larger colloidal particles (≤ 80 nm) of human serum albumin labelled with 99mTc could also be retained on the cartridge. The RCP of Tc-NanoHSA determined with SPE was similar to iTLC in methanol/water and in saline (Table 3), showing that Sep-Pak® makes it possible to separate the same hydrophilic impurities. Furthermore, this method may be used as a less expensive and rapid alternative for QC in the absence of a TLC scanner. However, the manual handling of SPE cartridges during this QC can result in a higher radiation dose to the operator and should be avoided. Furthermore, uncontrolled, manual elution may result in inaccurate and irreproducible results due to variations in the speed of elution.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Solid-phase extraction\": \"Reaction\", \"TLC\": \"Reaction\", \"Sep-Pak® cartridges\": \"Catalyst\", \"C18 hydrophobic reversed phase\": \"Condition\", \"non-polar compounds and particles\": \"Reactant\", \"Colloidal TcO2\": \"Reactant\", \"human serum albumin labelled with 99mTc\": \"Reactant\", \"Tc-NanoHSA\": \"Reactant\", \"SPE\": \"Reaction\", \"methanol/water\": \"Solvent\", \"saline\": \"Solvent\", \"hydrophilic impurities\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Sep-Pak® cartridges,non-polar compounds and particles>\": \"Used in\", \"<Sep-Pak® cartridges,Colloidal TcO2>\": \"Used in\", \"<Sep-Pak® cartridges,human serum albumin labelled with 99mTc>\": \"Used in\", \"<Sep-Pak® cartridges,Tc-NanoHSA>\": \"Used in\", \"<SPE,methanol/water>\": \"Used in\", \"<SPE,saline>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

It is one of the top 12 value-added chemicals which can be derived from biomass, according to a study by the United States Department of Energy . When considering biological production of chemical commodities such as 3-HP, it is important to ensure that the generated compounds are not re-metabolised by the producing organism at any stage during the process.

For example, in A. arabica bark extracts, phytochemical screening revealed the presence of terpenoids, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, and cardiac glycosides in both the acetone and the methanol plant extracts . Thus, the antibacterial activities in our study could also be attributed to secondary metabolites. While, the significant difference in antibacterial activities between A. rigidula and A. berlandieri could be attributed to (1) a difference in the specific secondary metabolites present in the respective extracts and/or (2) the concentration of extracted secondary metabolites in A. rigidula is higher than in A. berlandieri, thus contributing to the higher antibacterial activities observed in A. rigidula.

In an individual trajectory (n=1), unfolding from both termini occurred concomitantly. Very similar ratios were observed for the case of apoplastocyanin (80/20/0%, respectively, n=10), further validating the followed approach of constraining the organocopper bonds to study the initial stages of mechanical unfolding (Supplementary Fig. 13). Altogether, the in-silico unfolding trajectories demonstrate the unusual capability of both azurin and plastocyanin to mechanically unfold from both termini, lending strong support to the experimental data.

Combining bolometers and standalone thermistors in a same system can be beneficial for smart building applications, where sensing day/night cycles or overcast conditions can provide additional benefits when compared to standalone temperature sensing18. One solution-based family of materials with great promises for light-absorbing capabilities are methylammonium lead trihalide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Cl and/or Br). These precursor-based materials have made tremendous headway in photodetection and energy harvesting applications19–22, behaving as outstanding broadband light absorbers23–25. In this work, digital inkjet printing is successfully used to produce flexible thermistor and bolometer structures with interdigital silver electrodes and perovskite absorber layers.

These are amplified in the production of nanostructured carbon electrodes which are often more difficult to disperse in slurries and require more energy-intensive and longer processing. In this study we demonstrate a new process for preparing binder-free nanocarbon/nanoparticle (Fe–C) composite electrodes and study the effect of processing on the nanocomposite’s cycling performance in lithium cells. The binder-free electrodes were prepared by a two-step method: pulsed-electrodeposition of iron-based catalyst followed by chemical vapor deposition of a carbon film. SEM and TEM of the Fe–C showed that the active materials have a fibrous and tortuous morphology with disordered nanocrystalline domains characteristic of an amorphous carbon. The Fe–C electrodes showed good mechanical stability and an excellent cycle performance with an average stable capacity of 221 mAhg−1, and 85% capacity retention for up to 50 cycles. By reducing the number of processing steps and eliminating the use of binders and other chemicals this new method offers a “greener” alternative than current processing methods.Graphical abstractSynopsis: gains in sustainability can be achieved by eliminating use of binders, chemicals, and the number of electrode’s processing steps in this new method.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"battery materials\": \"Reactant\", \"electrodes\": \"Reactant\", \"slurries\": \"Reactant\", \"binders\": \"Reactant\", \"organic solvents\": \"Solvent\", \"additives\": \"Reactant\", \"nanostructured carbon electrodes\": \"Reactant\", \"nanocarbon/nanoparticle (Fe–C) composite electrodes\": \"Reactant\", \"iron-based catalyst\": \"Catalyst\", \"carbon film\": \"Reactant\", \"lithium cells\": \"Reactant\", \"processing\": \"Condition\", \"chemical vapor deposition\": \"Reaction\", \"pulsed-electrodeposition\": \"Reaction\", \"SEM and TEM\": \"Condition\", \"amorphous carbon\": \"Inorganic\", \"mechanical stability\": \"Condition\", \"cycle performance\": \"Condition\", \"number of processing steps\": \"Condition\", \"eliminating the use of binders and other chemicals\": \"Condition\", \"new method\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<nanocarbon/nanoparticle (Fe–C) composite electrodes,lithium cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<iron-based catalyst,carbon film>\": \"Created from\", \"<pulsed-electrodeposition,carbon film>\": \"Created from\", \"<chemical vapor deposition,carbon film>\": \"Created from\", \"<processing,number of processing steps>\": \"Along with\", \"<eliminating the use of binders and other chemicals,new method>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

By comparison of spectra taken on pure and Mn-doped ZnO NRs, a few new Raman impurity-related phonon modes, resulting from the presence of Mn in the investigated samples. We also present a vibrational and magnetic characterization of individual lying nanorods using Raman and MFM imaging. Confocal scanning micro-Raman mapping of the spatial distribution of intensity and frequency of phonon modes in single Mn-doped ZnO NRs nanorods is presented and analyzed for the first time. Mn-related local vibrational modes are also registered in Raman spectra of the single nanorod, confirming the incorporation of Mn into the ZnO host matrix. At higher Mn concentration the structural transformation toward the spinel phase ZnMn2O4 and Mn3O4 is observed mainly in 2D bottom layers. MFM images of Mn-doped ZnO NR arrays and single nanorod were studied in nanoscale at room temperature and demonstrate magnetic behavior. The circular domain magnetic pattern on top of single nanorod originated to superposition of some separate domains inside rod. This demonstrates that long-range ferromagnetic order is present at room temperature. Aligned Mn-doped ZnO NRs demonstrates that long-range ferromagnetic order and may be applied to future spintronic applications.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ZnO nanorods\": \"Reactant\", \"Mn\": \"Reactant\", \"aqueous chemical growth\": \"Reaction\", \"SEM\": \"Condition\", \"photoluminescence\": \"Condition\", \"Raman scattering\": \"Condition\", \"magnetic force microscopy\": \"Condition\", \"room temperature\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ZnO nanorods,aqueous chemical growth>\": \"Created from\", \"<Mn,ZnO nanorods>\": \"Used in\", \"<room temperature,Mn-doped ZnO NRs>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Such a wide bandgap variability along with additional tuning capabilities by using chemical functionalization, defect and/or strain engineering, external electric field, etc. make phosphorene especially attractive for optoelectronic applications in the visible and infrared (IR) spectral range, such as solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, photodetection, etc. In addition to its widely tunable bandgap, phosphorene can be switched between insulating and conducting states by substitutional or surface doping. Wang et al.11 have shown that adatoms of boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine act as impurities and induce mid-gap states leading to a metallic characteristic of phosphorene. High tunability of electrical properties, together with sufficiently flat morphology to confine electrons and facilitate high carrier mobility, makes phosphorene an interesting material for sensing applications, such as organic biosensors and implanted devices for reading life functions or vital signals.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"phosphorene\": \"Reactant\", \"bandgap\": \"Condition\", \"chemical functionalization\": \"Reaction\", \"defect and/or strain engineering\": \"Condition\", \"external electric field\": \"Condition\", \"solar energy harvesting\": \"Reaction\", \"photocatalysis\": \"Reaction\", \"photodetection\": \"Reaction\", \"boron\": \"Inorganic\", \"carbon\": \"Organic\", \"nitrogen\": \"Inorganic\", \"oxygen\": \"Inorganic\", \"fluorine\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<phosphorene,bandgap>\": \"Created by\", \"<phosphorene,solar energy harvesting>\": \"Used in\", \"<phosphorene,photocatalysis>\": \"Used in\", \"<phosphorene,photodetection>\": \"Used in\", \"<phosphorene,boron>\": \"Created from\", \"<phosphorene,carbon>\": \"Created from\", \"<phosphorene,nitrogen>\": \"Created from\", \"<phosphorene,oxygen>\": \"Created from\", \"<phosphorene,fluorine>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The abundance of several groups of benthic invertebrates, including chironomids, gastropods, and amphipods, was reduced in Midland Bay, Lake Huron, at concentrations of DDE ranging from 2.39 to 2.63 ng g−1, which are above the freshwater ISQG of 1.42 ng g−1 dw . Similarly, benthic species richness was low in sediments from Toronto Harbour, Ontario, with 11.5 μg·kg1 of DDE, which is above the freshwater PEL of 6.75 μg·kg−1. However, sediments containing DDE concentrations of 0.625 ng g−1, below the freshwater ISQG, exhibited a high degree of species richness . Organochlorine pesticides(OCPs) such as DDT, have been linked to several toxicological effects in various bird species, including, great white pelicans, hamerkop, African sacred ibis, and marabou stork in Ethiopia , and white stork nestlings in Spain .

By manipulating the processing conditions (amount of flux, firing time and temperature, and cooling rates) it is possible to manipulate the crystal morphology from microscopic fibres to large crystals (up to few millimetre long and ~100 μm thick). The crystal roughness can be controlled to achieve very flat surfaces by changing the melt composition “in situ” at high temperature. The Young modulus and hardness of the crystals are 110 ± 15 and 6.6 ± 1.5 GPa respectively as measured by nanoindentation. Crystal dissolution in Hanks solution starts around the defects. Several in vitro assays were performed; ClAp crystals with different size and shape are biocompatible. Cell apoptosis was very low at 5, 10, and 15 days (Caspase-3) for all the samples.

An epitaxial growth with sharp interfaces between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 layers was confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. An unambiguous charge transfer involving an electron transferring from the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 layers to Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 layers (Mn3+→Mn4+; Ti4+→Ti3+) across the interface were resolved by electron energy loss spectra analysis. These observations are attributed to the possible modification in the stereochemistry of the Ti and Mn ions in the interfacial region. The out-of-plane lattice parameter, Curie temperature, and magnetoresistance are strongly affected by the thicknesses of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 layers. Huge magnetoresistance subsisting to low temperature was also observed in the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 superlattices. All spectral changes identified at a nanometer scale and their potential effect on the degradation of magnetic and transport properties at a macroscopic level. These findings highlight the importance of dependence on sublayer thickness, illustrating the high degree of tenability in these artificially low-dimensional oxide materials.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"La0.7Sr0.3MnO3\": \"Reactant\", \"Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3\": \"Reactant\", \"electron\": \"Reactant\", \"thicknesses of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 layers\": \"Condition\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<La0.7Sr0.3MnO3,electron>\": \"Created from\", \"<Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3,electron>\": \"Created from\", \"<thicknesses of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 layers,temperature>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

A high TOF (>8000 h−1) and productivity (5.8 g h−1 of aniline) were recorded for this reaction using a Pt1-MoS2 catalyst module. In-situ DRIFTS and DFT calculations confirm that the chemoselectivity originates from the pyramidal Pt-3S structure of the catalyst, which prefers the “end-on” adsorption of the nitro groups in organic molecules. The pyramidal Pt-3S coordination structure binds strongly to MoS2 and prevents leaching during the flow reaction, resulting in highly stable performance in the continuous operation at low and quantitative conversions. The successful demonstration of exceptionally high quantitative conversion in SAC-catalysed reactions operated under fast flow condition paves the way for their application in liquid phase synthesis of fine chemicals.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"SAC-catalysed chemoselective reduction\": \"Reaction\", \"nitro compounds\": \"Reactant\", \"anilines\": \"Reactant\", \"fine chemicals\": \"Reactant\", \"bench-top flow cell\": \"Condition\", \"Pt1-MoS2 catalyst module\": \"Catalyst\", \"pyramidal Pt-3S structure\": \"Catalyst\", \"MoS2\": \"Inorganic\", \"flow reaction\": \"Condition\", \"fast flow condition\": \"Condition\", \"liquid phase synthesis\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<SAC-catalysed chemoselective reduction,nitro compounds>\": \"Created from\", \"<SAC-catalysed chemoselective reduction,fine chemicals>\": \"Created from\", \"<Pt1-MoS2 catalyst module,SAC-catalysed chemoselective reduction>\": \"Used in\", \"<pyramidal Pt-3S structure,Pt1-MoS2 catalyst module>\": \"Created by\", \"<flow reaction,Pt1-MoS2 catalyst module>\": \"Along with\", \"<fast flow condition,SAC-catalysed chemoselective reduction>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

However mean concentrations of dissolved macronutrient are typically low in the tropics except in waters exposed to terrestrial runoff and upwelling, with maximum observed concentrations of phosphate and DIN of 0.24 and 3.8 mmol/kg, respectively (Table 1). River nutrient load data are only available on a yearly basis, so could not be included into the models. However, at this site macronutrient availability did not appear to be a dominant driver of the CO2 variation on seasonal scales. Overall, concentrations of alkalinity and DIC appear typically lower in Burdekin River discharge waters than in seawater, but they are higher in alkalinity than in DIC50. Due to the sparsity of relevant river data and complex hydrodynamics, it remains unclear to what extent rivers affect the alkalinity and inorganic carbon concentrations of GBR ecosystems, either directly through their DIC, alkalinity and nutrient loads, or indirectly via stimulation of biological processes.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"carbon chemistry variables\": \"Reactant\", \"phosphate\": \"Inorganic\", \"DIN\": \"Inorganic\", \"CO2\": \"Inorganic\", \"alkalinity\": \"Inorganic\", \"DIC\": \"Inorganic\", \"GBR ecosystems\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<carbon chemistry variables,phosphate>\": \"Created from\", \"<carbon chemistry variables,DIN>\": \"Created from\", \"<carbon chemistry variables,CO2>\": \"Created from\", \"<carbon chemistry variables,alkalinity>\": \"Created from\", \"<carbon chemistry variables,DIC>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Moreover, there is a growing concern worldwide to develop pesticides with low impact to environment and non-target organisms. Hexane-soluble fraction from ethanolic crude extract from fruits of Manilkara subsericea and its triterpenes were considered active against a cotton pest (Dysdercus peruvianus). Several natural products with insecticidal activity have poor water solubility, including triterpenes, and nanotechnology has emerged as a good alternative to solve this main problem. On this context, the aim of the present study was to develop an insecticidal nanoemulsion containing apolar fraction from fruits of Manilkara subsericea.ResultsIt was obtained a formulation constituted by 5% of oil (octyldodecyl myristate), 5% of surfactants (sorbitan monooleate/polysorbate 80), 5% of apolar fraction from M. subsericea and 85% of water. Analysis of mean droplet diameter (155.2 ± 3.8 nm) confirmed this formulation as a nanoemulsion. It was able to induce mortality in D. peruvianus. It was observed no effect against acetylcholinesterase or mortality in mice induced by the formulation, suggesting the safety of this nanoemulsion for non-target organisms.ConclusionsThe present study suggests that the obtained O/A nanoemulsion may be useful to enhance water solubility of poor water soluble natural products with insecticidal activity, including the hexane-soluble fraction from ethanolic crude extract from fruits of Manilkara subsericea.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Hexane-soluble fraction\": \"Reactant\", \"Ethanolic crude extract\": \"Reactant\", \"Manilkara subsericea\": \"Organic\", \"triterpenes\": \"Organic\", \"water\": \"Solvent\", \"nanoemulsion\": \"Reactant\", \"oil\": \"Reactant\", \"surfactants\": \"Reactant\", \"apolar fraction\": \"Reactant\", \"acetylcholinesterase\": \"Reactant\", \"mice\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Hexane-soluble fraction,triterpenes>\": \"Created from\", \"<Ethanolic crude extract,Manilkara subsericea>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoemulsion,oil>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoemulsion,surfactants>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoemulsion,apolar fraction>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoemulsion,water>\": \"Created from\", \"<acetylcholinesterase,mice>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

However, cyanobacteria have very low tolerance to the toxic butanol, which limits the economic viability of this renewable system.ResultsThrough a long-term experimental evolution process, we achieved a 150% increase of the butanol tolerance in a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 after a continuous 94 passages for 395 days in BG11 media amended with gradually increased butanol concentration from 0.2% to 0.5% (v/v). To decipher the molecular mechanism responsible for the tolerance increase, we employed an integrated GC-MS and LC-MS approach to determine metabolomic profiles of the butanol-tolerant Synechocystis strains isolated from several stages of the evolution, and then applied PCA and WGCNA network analyses to identify the key metabolites and metabolic modules related to the increased tolerance. The results showed that unstable metabolites of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3PG), D-fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), D-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), NADPH, phosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP), D-ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), and stable metabolites of glycerol, L-serine and stearic acid were differentially regulated during the evolution process, which could be related to tolerance increase to butanol in Synechocystis.ConclusionsThe study provided the first time-series description of the metabolomic changes related to the gradual increase of butanol tolerance, and revealed a metabolomic basis important for rational tolerance engineering in Synechocystis.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"cyanobacteria\": \"Reactant\", \"butanol\": \"Reactant\", \"CO2\": \"Reactant\", \"Synechocystis sp.

The effect of POSS dispersion in the epoxy resin in terms of mechanical, and thermal properties were reported. The three solvent used to disperse POSS in this work are ethanol, acetone, and toluene. The POSS was initially dispersed in the solvent followed by an addition in the epoxy resin by systematically varying the weight fraction from 0.5 to 8 wt%. Mechanical properties of nanocomposites were characterized in terms of elastic modulus, and fracture toughness. The obtained result illustrates that nanocomposites prepared by polar solvent dispersion such as ethanol showed an increase in values of elastic modulus and fracture toughness value. The increase in the modulus and fracture toughness value is due to the better interaction between POSS and ethanol disperse the POSS uniformly in the epoxy resin while avoiding the agglomeration. However, nanocomposites prepared by nonpolar solvent does not show substantial change in the mechanical properties. Fractured surface morphology was studied using scanning electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis illustrates that with better POSS dispersion value of glass transition temperature (Tg) increased. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy showed that POSS completely interacted with the epoxy resin and no phase separation was observed.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)\": \"Reactant\", \"epoxy resin\": \"Reactant\", \"ethanol\": \"Solvent\", \"acetone\": \"Solvent\", \"toluene\": \"Solvent\", \"weight fraction\": \"Condition\", \"glass transition temperature (Tg)\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS),epoxy resin>\": \"Created from\", \"<polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS),ethanol>\": \"Used in\", \"<polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxoxane (POSS),acetone>\": \"Used in\", \"<polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS),toluene>\": \"Used in\", \"<weight fraction,polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)>\": \"Created by\", \"<glass transition temperature (Tg),polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

In organisms like E. coli, furfural is detoxified via NADPH-dependent reduction to furfuryl alcohol, which is less toxic. This is thought to decrease the amount of NADPH available for biosynthesis and inhibit growth . Supplementation of E. coli with cysteine or increasing the concentration of NADPH increased furfural tolerance, suggesting that cysteine metabolism is intimately tied to the redox state of the cell. Sulfate reduction genes are also differentially expressed in response to chemical redox perturbation , and addition of excess sulfate helped recover viability of a C. thermocellum mutant with perturbed redox metabolism .

The newly characterized cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 is a promising candidate for serving as a microbial cell factory because of its unusually rapid growth rate. Here, we seek to develop a genetic toolkit that enables extensive genomic engineering of Synechococcus 2973 by implementing a CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. We targeted the nblA gene because of its important role in biological response to nitrogen deprivation conditions.ResultsFirst, we determined that the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme is toxic in cyanobacteria, and conjugational transfer of stable, replicating constructs containing the cas9 gene resulted in lethality. However, after switching to a vector that permitted transient expression of the cas9 gene, we achieved markerless editing in 100 % of cyanobacterial exconjugants after the first patch. Moreover, we could readily cure the organisms of antibiotic resistance, resulting in a markerless deletion strain.ConclusionsHigh expression levels of the Cas9 protein in Synechococcus 2973 appear to be toxic and result in cell death. However, introduction of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system on a plasmid backbone that leads to transient cas9 expression allowed for efficient markerless genome editing in a wild type genetic background.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973\": \"Reactant\", \"CRISPR/Cas9 editing system\": \"Reaction\", \"nblA gene\": \"Reactant\", \"Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme\": \"Catalyst\", \"cas9 gene\": \"Reactant\", \"Cas9 protein\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973,CRISPR/Cas9 editing system>\": \"Used in\", \"<CRISPR/Cas9 editing system,nblA gene>\": \"Created from\", \"<Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme,cas9 gene>\": \"Used in\", \"<cas9 gene,Cas9 protein>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Indeed, adding iodine in B-rich compositions decreases the  components and increases the contribution around 16 ppm corresponding to the  units (boroxol rings). Sample NBS20-5.1I2 has the highest amount of incorporated iodine (~5 mol%) and it presents the strongest modifications in the B environment, with a net decrease of the B:1B, 3Si component at ∼0 ppm in the NMR spectrum. To obtain more detailed structural information, 11B 3QMAS spectra were collected for the B end-member glass synthetized in air, and the one doped with a nominal amount of 9 mol% I (Fig. 5B). As seen from the isotropic dimension spectra (displayed vertically in Fig. 5B), the variations in the  ring/non-ring distribution and the decrease of the  are confirmed.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"iodine\": \"Reactant\", \"structural variations\": \"Condition\", \"B-rich compositions\": \"Reactant\", \"boroxol rings\": \"Organic\", \"NBS20-5.1I2\": \"Reactant\", \"B environment\": \"Condition\", \"B:1B, 3Si component\": \"Inorganic\", \"air\": \"Condition\", \"9 mol% I\": \"Reactant\", \"isotropic dimension spectra\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<iodine,B-rich compositions>\": \"Used in\", \"<iodine,NBS20-5.1I2>\": \"Used in\", \"<9 mol% I,isotropic dimension spectra>\": \"Used in\", \"<B environment,B:1B, 3Si component>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

As well, we must connect this detailed surface chemistry to the routes for PM toxicity, such as the ability of PM to promote redox cycling and ROS generation. To that end, the central hypothesis in this work is that reactive oxidation chemistry with soot particles involves interactions with either polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are known to coat combustion particles, or with the chemically unsaturated graphitic soot backbone that has PAH-like character. In particular, it is well known that quinones are oxidation products of PAHs12,13,14,15, which are potential redox-cycling agents. Indeed, gas-surface oxidation of adsorbed anthracene by ozone has identified anthraquinone as a major oxidation product16.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"molecular-level understanding\": \"Condition\", \"composition\": \"Reactant\", \"atmospheric processing mechanisms\": \"Reaction\", \"particles\": \"Reactant\", \"surface chemistry\": \"Reaction\", \"PM toxicity\": \"Condition\", \"redox cycling\": \"Reaction\", \"ROS generation\": \"Reaction\", \"reactive oxidation chemistry\": \"Reaction\", \"soot particles\": \"Reactant\", \"polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\": \"Organic\", \"combustion particles\": \"Reactant\", \"graphitic soot backbone\": \"Reactant\", \"quinones\": \"Organic\", \"anthracene\": \"Organic\", \"ozone\": \"Reactant\", \"anthraquinone\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<quinones,anthracene>\": \"Created from\", \"<reactive oxidation chemistry,soot particles>\": \"Used in\", \"<polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,combustion particles>\": \"Created from\", \"<graphitic soot backbone,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons>\": \"Created from\", \"<ozone,anthracene>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

The method of van der Geize  was used to generate a ΔpcaHG gene deletion mutant strain of R. jostii RHA1, using vector pK18mobsacB. The ΔpcaHG gene deletion strain showed only slightly reduced growth on lysogeny broth, compared to wild-type R. jostii RHA1, but when grown on M9 minimal media containing 0.1% PCA as carbon source, showed little or no growth over 48 h (see Additional file 1: Figure S3), consistent with the β-ketoadipate pathway being the major pathway for catabolism of protocatechuic acid.

At the current selling price of 1500–1700 USD/ton, itaconic acid is already becoming competitive to replace fossil polyacrylic acid in the production of superabsorbent polymers . Still, to access other bulk markets like methyl methacrylate, which is currently produced from acetone cyanohydrin (about 1000 USD/ton), the price of itaconic acid has to drop further. Besides reducing the processing costs, the price of itaconic acid can be further reduced by using cheaper substrates. For comparison, the current sugar prices are about 310 USD/ton while pulp grade wood costs only about 35 USD/ton . The cheap and sustainable production of itaconic acid from cellulosic waste streams is therefore a highly anticipated goal of current research .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Itaconic acid\": \"Reactant\", \"polymer synthesis\": \"Reaction\", \"biofuel production\": \"Reaction\", \"fossil polyacrylic acid\": \"Reactant\", \"superabsorbent polymers\": \"Reactant\", \"methyl methacrylate\": \"Reactant\", \"acetone cyanohydrin\": \"Reactant\", \"sugar prices\": \"Condition\", \"pulp grade wood\": \"Condition\", \"cellulosic waste streams\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Itaconic acid,polymer synthesis>\": \"Used in\", \"<Itaconic acid,biofuel production>\": \"Used in\", \"<Itaconic acid,fossil polyacrylic acid>\": \"Created from\", \"<Itaconic acid,methyl methacrylate>\": \"Created from\", \"<Itaconic acid,acetone cyanohydrin>\": \"Created from\", \"<Itaconic acid,sugar prices>\": \"Created by\", \"<Itaconic acid,pulp grade wood>\": \"Created by\", \"<Itaconic acid,cellulosic waste streams>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

In this context, the use of nanocarriers is currently investigated in order to overcome these drawbacks. In this contribution, we report a new type of sorafenib-based nanoparticles stabilized by hybrid nucleoside-lipids. The solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) showed negative or positive zeta potential values depending on the nucleoside-lipid charge. Transmission electron microscopy of sorafenib-loaded SLNs revealed parallelepiped nanoparticles of about 200 nm. Biological studies achieved on four different cell lines, including liver and breast cancers, revealed enhanced anticancer activities of Sorafenib-based SLNs compared to the free drug. Importantly, contrast phase microscopy images recorded after incubation of cancer cells in the presence of SLNs at high concentration in sorafenib (> 80 μM) revealed a total cancer cell death in all cases. These results highlight the potential of nucleoside-lipid-based SLNs as drug delivery systems.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"sorafenib\": \"Reactant\", \"nanocarriers\": \"Reactant\", \"nucleoside-lipids\": \"Reactant\", \"solid lipid nanoparticles\": \"Reactant\", \"cancer cells\": \"Reactant\", \"water\": \"Solvent\", \"toxicity\": \"Condition\", \"side effects\": \"Condition\", \"concentration\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<sorafenib,nanocarriers>\": \"Used in\", \"<sorafenib,solid lipid nanoparticles>\": \"Created from\", \"<solid lipid nanoparticles,cancer cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<concentration,solid lipid nanoparticles>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Fifty milligrams of the photocatalyst was mixed with 50 mL of RhB aqueous solution (10 mg L−1) and stirred in darkness for a certain time before illumination to ensure adsorption balance. In the reaction process, cooling water is used to keep the system temperature constant at room temperature. A 1000-W Xenon lamp provides illumination to simulate visible light. LAMBDA35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to characterize the concentration (C) change of RhB solution at λ = 553 nm. The decolorization rate is indicated as a function of time vs Ct/C0.

These highly efficient OLEDs are generally manufactured using evaporative methods and are comprised of small-molecule heteroleptic phosphorescent iridium(III) complexes blended with a host and additional layers to balance charge injection and transport. Large area OLEDs for lighting and display applications would benefit from low-cost solution processing, provided that high EQEs could be achieved. Here, we show that poly(dendrimer)s consisting of a non-conjugated polymer backbone with iridium(III) complexes forming the cores of first-generation dendrimer side chains can be co-deposited with a host by solution processing to give highly efficient devices. Simple bilayer devices comprising the emissive layer and an electron transport layer gave an EQE of >20% at luminances of up to ≈300 cd/m2, showing that polymer engineering can enable alignment of the emissive dipole of solution-processed phosphorescent materials.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"organic light-emitting diode (OLED)\": \"Organic\", \"phosphorescent emitters\": \"Reactant\", \"iridium(III) complexes\": \"Inorganic\", \"poly(dendrimer)s\": \"Organic\", \"emissive dipole\": \"Condition\", \"solution processing\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<phosphorescent emitters,iridium(III) complexes>\": \"Created from\", \"<poly(dendrimer)s,iridium(III) complexes>\": \"Created from\", \"<emissive dipole,solution processing>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Inducible expression systems are applied to separate the cultivation into an initial growth phase for unimpeded biomass formation and a subsequent production phase where growth is impeded while metabolic resources are shifted towards product formation. The switch from growth to production phase (induction of target gene expression) can be achieved by addition of small chemical inducer molecules among which isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is the most popular choice and widely applied, especially in lab scale. The amount of IPTG and the time when it is added during cultivation are crucial parameters for process performance . If induction is performed too early, biomass concentration is insufficient for reasonable protein production; if it is performed too late, not enough substrate is left for product formation. If IPTG concentration is not sufficiently high, cells may not reach their full expression potential; however, if IPTG concentration exceeds a critical limit, a balanced metabolism cannot be maintained and toxic effects might be observed .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"strains\": \"Reactant\", \"culture conditions\": \"Condition\", \"process related parameters\": \"Condition\", \"isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)\": \"Reactant\", \"biomass\": \"Reactant\", \"protein production\": \"Reaction\", \"metabolic resources\": \"Reactant\", \"product formation\": \"Reaction\", \"growth\": \"Condition\", \"target gene expression\": \"Reaction\", \"small chemical inducer molecules\": \"Reactant\", \"time\": \"Condition\", \"amount of IPTG\": \"Condition\", \"cells\": \"Reactant\", \"expression potential\": \"Condition\", \"toxic effects\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),biomass>\": \"Created from\", \"<isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),protein production>\": \"Used in\", \"<isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),product formation>\": \"Used in\", \"<isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),expression potential>\": \"Used in\", \"<isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),toxic effects>\": \"Used in\", \"<time,isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)>\": \"Along with\", \"<amount of IPTG,isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Particularly, the performance of butanol production (yield, productivity, and selectivity) was significantly enhanced using a mixture of glucose and glycerol, compared to using glucose only. Thus, IB fermentation favoring butanol production with Clostridium sp. A1424 is especially valuable for the efficient carbon recovery to IB and butanol, a promising biofuel.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Clostridium sp.

There was no significant difference in OCP values of Cu electrodes without riboflavin and with riboflavin. The daily OCP values of Ni electrodes with riboflavin were lower than that without riboflavin. The OCP values of Cu electrodes (−750 ± 80 mV, vs. saturated calomel electrode, SCE) were more negative than that of Ni electrodes (−600 ± 50 mV), indicating a stronger corrosion tendency for Cu MIC than for Ni MIC.Fig. 10OCP and Rp.Variation of the OCP (a) and Rp (b) of the Cu and Ni coupons during the 7-d incubation in the D. vulgaris media without and with riboflavin.

Overexpression of the structural genes for enzymes of the non-oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway (non-ox PPP↑; pTDH3-RPE1, pPGK1-TKL1, pTEF1-TAL1, pPGI1-NQM1, pTPI1-RKI1 and pPYK1-TKL2) was implemented to increase supply of ribulose-5-phosphate, while multiple copies of a bacterial cbbm RuBisCO expression cassette were integrated in the yeast genome to improve conversion of ribulose-5-bisphosphate into 3-phosphoglycerate. Moreover, GPD2, which encodes an isoenzyme of NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was deleted to reduce competition for biosynthetic NADH in fast-growing cultures. Finally, expression of the spinach PRK gene from the anaerobically inducible DAN1 promoter  limited toxic effects of PRK during aerobic pre-cultivation. The resulting PRK/RuBisCO-synthesizing S. cerevisiae strain (IMX1489; Δgpd2, non-ox PPP↑, pDAN1-prk, 15 × cbbm, GroES/GroEL) showed essentially the same maximum growth rate on glucose as a non-engineered reference strain in anaerobic batch bioreactors while showing an 86% lower glycerol yield and an over 10% higher ethanol yield than the reference strain .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"PRK/RuBisCO-expressing S. cerevisiae strains\": \"Reactant\", \"anaerobic batch cultures\": \"Condition\", \"enzymes of the non-oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway\": \"Catalyst\", \"ribulose-5-phosphate\": \"Reactant\", \"bacterial cbbm RuBisCO expression cassette\": \"Catalyst\", \"yeast genome\": \"Reactant\", \"GPD2\": \"Catalyst\", \"NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\": \"Catalyst\", \"spinach PRK gene\": \"Reactant\", \"anaerobically inducible DAN1 promoter\": \"Condition\", \"glucose\": \"Reactant\", \"ethanol\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<enzymes of the non-oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway,ribulose-5-phosphate>\": \"Created from\", \"<bacterial cbbm RuBisCO expression cassette,yeast genome>\": \"Used in\", \"<GPD2,NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase>\": \"Created by\", \"<spinach PRK gene,anaerobically inducible DAN1 promoter>\": \"Created by\", \"<glucose,ethanol>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Both the Rq and SAR were slightly increased up to 600 °C due to the growth of NPs size. However, as the Ag sublimation was intensified at a high temperature, the NPs were again reduced in size. Meanwhile, the shape of NPs became more spherical with the improved uniformity as NPs could possess an equilibrium configuration with the minimum surface energy. Again, these results clearly demonstrated a significant improvement in the size, shape, and uniformity of AgPt NPs in comparison with the pure NPs of parent elements from the previous studies, which can be attributed to the enhanced diffusion with the AgPt alloy system .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"NPs\": \"Reactant\", \"Rq\": \"Condition\", \"SAR\": \"Condition\", \"Ag\": \"Inorganic\", \"AgPt NPs\": \"Reactant\", \"AgPt alloy system\": \"Reactant\", \"diffusion\": \"Reaction\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<NPs,Rq>\": \"Created by\", \"<NPs,SAR>\": \"Created by\", \"<Ag,AgPt NPs>\": \"Created from\", \"<AgPt NPs,diffusion>\": \"Used in\", \"<AgPt NPs,temperature>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Traditionally, researchers used Indium Tin Oxides (ITO) as anode to fabricate OLEDs. As one of the most potential substitutes for ITO , copper nanowire (CuNW) transparent conductive film (TCF) has become the focus of considerable research activities, because copper has larger reserves and lower price . Compared with silver nanowire (AgNW) film, the above advantages of CuNW film still holds. CuNW TCF has gradually shown its commercial application prospects. When the CuNW film is used as the anode of OLED, its work function is not high, it is easy to be oxidized, and its roughness is relatively high. Therefore, it is necessary to improve oxidation resistance of CuNW TCF, reduce its roughness and improve its work function.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Indium Tin Oxides (ITO)\": \"Reactant\", \"copper nanowire (CuNW)\": \"Reactant\", \"silver nanowire (AgNW)\" : \"Reactant\", \"oxidation\": \"Reaction\", \"work function\": \"Condition\", \"roughness\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<copper nanowire (CuNW),oxidation>\": \"Created from\", \"<copper nanowire (CuNW),work function>\": \"Created by\", \"<copper nanowire (CuNW),roughness>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The principal issue in describing charged defects is the electrostatic interaction between repeating centres. The long-range Coulomb interaction depends on the defect charge q, their spatial arrangement, and the dielectric response of the host ϵ(r). The standard solution is to introduce a homogeneous ‘jellium’ background charge to enforce charge neutrality in each repeat unit and ensure convergent Coulomb energy. This fix results in a shift in the average electrostatic potential and total energy of the defective supercell that must be corrected to become useful (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Defect correction schemes.Illustration of the variety of correction procedures for the calculation of charged defects under periodic boundary conditions.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"supercell\": \"Reactant\", \"periodic boundary conditions\": \"Condition\", \"charged defects\": \"Reactant\", \"electrostatic interaction\": \"Reaction\", \"homogeneous ‘jellium’ background charge\": \"Catalyst\", \"charge neutrality\": \"Condition\", \"average electrostatic potential\": \"Condition\", \"total energy\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<charged defects,electrostatic interaction>\": \"Created from\", \"<electrostatic interaction,homogeneous ‘jellium’ background charge>\": \"Used in\", \"<homogeneous ‘jellium’ background charge,charge neutrality>\": \"Created by\", \"<charge neutrality,average electrostatic potential>\": \"Along with\", \"<average electrostatic potential,total energy>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The aim was to generate end products that could be recycled into textiles. The isolated end products from the process were TPA, EG, and cotton. The separation and purification of EG were not considered in this study.

However, it is a well-known fact that products with a better microstructure can be obtained by providing homogenous grain distribution in the materials produced by the P/M method , and that the corrosion resistance of biomedical materials is directly related to the microstructure . Therefore, the aims of the present study were the application of new methods to enable the production of Mg alloys by the P/M technique, creating biomaterials with superior biocorrosion properties, determining Zn effect on degradation behaviour of Mg–Sn–Zn alloys and investigating the toxic effects of these alloys on human neuron cells (SH-SY5Y).","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Mg alloys\": \"Reactant\", \"casting method\": \"Condition\", \"P/M method\": \"Condition\", \"oxygen\": \"Reactant\", \"microstructure\": \"Condition\", \"biomaterials\": \"Reactant\", \"biocorrosion properties\": \"Condition\", \"Zn\": \"Reactant\", \"degradation behaviour\": \"Reaction\", \"Mg–Sn–Zn alloys\": \"Reactant\", \"toxic effects\": \"Reaction\", \"human neuron cells\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Mg alloys,casting method>\": \"Created by\", \"<Mg alloys,P/M method>\": \"Created by\", \"<Mg alloys,oxygen>\": \"Created from\", \"<biomaterials,microstructure>\": \"Created by\", \"<biomaterials,biocorrosion properties>\": \"Created by\", \"<Zn,degradation behaviour>\": \"Used in\", \"<Mg–Sn–Zn alloys,toxic effects>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Overall, we found a 3.5- and 1.7-fold average reduction to on-target editing at the YFP and ABE16 loci, respectively, upon intradomain insertion of ABEmax in nSpCas9 (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). Counterintuitively however, we also noted that this permutation resulted in a marked increase in the incidence of RNA off-target events at the DNAJB transcript compared to its wild-type counterpart, but reduced off-target events at the SCAP transcript (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7). For the miniABEmax (V82G) variant, on-target DNA editing was dramatically abrogated when the evolved ecTadA monomer was inlaid compared to its native conformation, but no appreciable difference to the RNA editing profile was observed (15.5- and 8.5-fold average reductions for ABE16 and YFP loci, respectively). Altogether, these findings suggest that both the DNA and RNA activity profiles of ABEs can be altered based upon their domain positioning in nSpCas9.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ABEmax\": \"Reactant\", \"miniABEmax (V82G)\": \"Reactant\", \"nSpCas9\": \"Reactant\", \"YFP\": \"Reactant\", \"ABE16\": \"Reactant\", \"DNAJB\": \"Reactant\", \"SCAP\": \"Reactant\", \"ecTadA monomer\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ABEmax,nSpCas9>\": \"Used in\", \"<miniABEmax (V82G),nSpCas9>\": \"Used in\", \"<ecTadA monomer,miniABEmax (V82G)>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Restriction enzymes, Pfu polymerase and T4 ligase were from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). The coding sequence of dimeric C-terminal domain of human ZnT8 consisting of amino acids 268–369  and amino acids 268–369  were optimized for prokaryotic expression. The ZnT8 optimized nucleotide sequence was synthesized by GenScript (GenScript Corporation, Piscataway, NJ, USA; http://www.GenScript.com) including KpnI and XbaI sites at the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively. The synthesized construct (682 bp) was obtained from GenScript in plasmid pUC57 and maintained in E. coli strain JM109 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After propagation and purification of the vector with QIAprep spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), ZnT8 construct was digested with KpnI and XbaI and ligated into the pTrxFus linearized vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Researchers recently found that lactate can regulate protein functions through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) by conjugating to protein Lys residues and generating a ‘LactoylLys’ modification on proteins, revealing non-metabolic functions of lactate . Protein lactylation is a new topic currently studied mainly in mammals, as protein lactylation plays an important role in diseases, such as neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases. Studies related to protein lactylation in algae have not been reported. Protein lactylation is positively correlated with intracellular lactate concentration . In this study, lactate was the most significantly upregulated metabolite under both LN and HC conditions. The WB results (Fig. 4) indicated proteins in P. tricornutum had undergone lactylation, which was particularly evident under LN and HC conditions. Lactylated proteomics under NC condition revealed that lactylated proteins were significantly involved in photosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, central carbon metabolism including Calvin cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and nitrogen metabolism, confirming protein lactylation in P. tricornutum played an important role in C:N balance regulation, energy homeostasis maintenance and fatty acid synthesis.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"lactate\": \"Reactant\", \"protein Lys residues\": \"Reactant\", \"‘LactoylLys’ modification on proteins\": \"Reactant\", \"protein lactylation\": \"Reaction\", \"intracellular lactate concentration\": \"Condition\", \"LN and HC conditions\": \"Condition\", \"NC condition\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<lactate,’LactoylLys’ modification on proteins>\": \"Created from\", \"<protein Lys residues,’LactoylLys’ modification on proteins>\": \"Created from\", \"<protein lactylation,intracellular lactate concentration>\": \"Along with\", \"<protein lactylation,LN and HC conditions>\": \"Along with\", \"<protein lactylation,NC condition>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

At specific time intervals (10 min, 30 min, 1 h or 2 h), mice were sacrificed and the GI tract was exposed to determine the absorption of the FITC-INS/GOx loaded GR-NPs in GI-tract. As shown in Fig. 6b, weak green fluorescence should be seen after 10 min oral administration and got stronger with increasing time, a significant increase in signal 2 h later (Fig. 6c). The fluorescence intensity of 60 min and 120 min was 2.8 times and 4.5 times higher than that of 30 min, respectively. This result was consistent with CLSM observation of Caco-2 cells in vitro (Fig. 6a). As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S10, the bioadhesion ability of FITC-INS/GOx loaded GR-NPs on duodenum, ileum, jejunum and colon of SD rats was significantly observed after 2 h oral administration. In contrast, the signal of pure FITC-INS showed a weak green fluorescence in different parts of small intestine.

Thus, nature probably can provide us the best biomaterials for the construction of enzymatic compartments. The branched β-(1,3; 1,6)-glucan particles (GPs) from yeast cell walls are porous hollow microspheres with physico-chemically stable and biocompatible properties25. The permeability of the GPs allows small molecules and biomolecules (e.g., Rifampicin, RNA, DNA) to enter and leave the capsule interior freely25–27. Apart from the permeability, this nontoxic capsule not only provides a cavity for loading cargoes because of the hollow cavity inside the GPs together with a rather “biofriendly” package mode but also potentially contributes a confined reaction space just as their inherently protective and filtered responsibility in living systems, which makes GPs a kind of promising candidate for constructing enzymatic compartments in non-living systems.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"biomaterials\": \"Reactant\", \"energy conversion and storage\": \"Reaction\", \"enzymatic compartments\": \"Reactant\", \"β-(1,3; 1,6)-glucan particles\": \"Reactant\", \"small molecules and biomolecules\": \"Reactant\", \"Rifampicin\": \"Organic\", \"RNA\": \"Organic\", \"DNA\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<β-(1,3; 1,6)-glucan particles,small molecules and biomolecules>\": \"Used in\", \"<β-(1,3; 1,6)-glucan particles,Rifampicin>\": \"Used in\", \"<β-(1,3; 1,6)-glucan particles,RNA>\": \"Used in\", \"<β-(1,3; 1,6)-glucan particles,DNA>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

A reference cell is also assembled from Li2S@MX cathode and Cu foil with liquid electrolyte as a comparison. Restricted by robust CGPE, smooth Li plating/stripping occurs in Li2S@MX|CGPE|Cu cells to maintain the interfacial properties stable during cycling, as reflected by stable Rct and Rsurf (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Fig. 32 and Supplementary Table 5). Upon charge, the thickness of Li layer on Cu substrate gradually increases, followed by complete Li stripping after discharge (Fig. 5G). The interface between Li and CGPE keeps flat without any deformation by Li dendrite growth throughout Li plating/stripping at a current density of 1.2 mA cm−2. In contrast, the growth of granular Li is triggered on Cu foil in as early as 10 % DOC, which serves as the nucleation site to guide the mossy Li dendrite growth and irreversibly damage the electrode-electrolyte interface. After discharge, a high residue of “dead Li” is electrically isolated from the electrochemical system, causing low Li utilization, poor cell reversibility and rapid cell failure.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Li2S@MX|CGPE|Cu cells\": \"Reactant\", \"liquid electrolyte\": \"Solvent\", \"Li2S@MX cathode\": \"Reactant\", \"Cu foil\": \"Reactant\", \"Li layer\": \"Reactant\", \"CGPE\": \"Catalyst\", \"current density of 1.2 mA cm−2\": \"Condition\", \"granular Li\": \"Reactant\", \"mossy Li dendrite growth\": \"Reaction\", \"electrode-electrolyte interface\": \"Reactant\", \"“dead Li”\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Li2S@MX|CGPE|Cu cells,liquid electrolyte>\": \"Used in\", \"<Li2S@MX|CGPE|Cu cells,current density of 1.2 mA cm−2>\": \"Along with\", \"<Li2S@MX cathode,Cu foil>\": \"Created from\", \"<Li layer,CGPE>\": \"Created by\", \"<granular Li,mossy Li dendrite growth>\": \"Created from\", \"<“dead Li”,electrode-electrolyte interface>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The diversity in pore size influences their permeability and selectivity for guest species. Micropore materials allow small molecules to transport and adsorb and are usually applied for gas separation and filtration, catalytic transformations, ion exchangers and absorbents. Mesoporous materials can be used as catalysts or catalyst supports in the conversion of larger molecules; they have biomedical applications in enzyme immobilization, biocatalysis, drug delivery and sensors due to their large range of sizes (2–50 nm). Macroporous materials have unique optical properties due to their porous size being comparable to optical wavelengths. Furthermore, macroporous materials are applied in the biomedical field due to their large porous sizes, such as macroporous scaffolds for the regeneration of new tissue and the growth of cells. To date, mesoporous materials have attracted significant attention in biomedical applications, especially in cancer therapy, due to their sizes, which primarily influence biodistribution after injection into the bloodstream.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"pore structure\": \"Condition\", \"porous materials\": \"Reactant\", \"gas separation and filtration\": \"Reaction\", \"catalytic transformations\": \"Reaction\", \"ion exchangers and absorbents\": \"Reaction\", \"catalysts\": \"Catalyst\", \"conversion of larger molecules\": \"Reaction\", \"enzyme immobilization\": \"Reaction\", \"biocatalysis\": \"Reaction\", \"drug delivery\": \"Reaction\", \"macroporous materials\": \"Reactant\", \"optical properties\": \"Condition\", \"macroporous scaffolds\": \"Reactant\", \"regeneration of new tissue\": \"Reaction\", \"growth of cells\": \"Reaction\", \"mesoporous materials\": \"Reactant\", \"cancer therapy\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<porous materials,gas separation and filtration>\": \"Used in\", \"<catalysts,conversion of larger molecules>\": \"Used in\", \"<macroporous materials,optical properties>\": \"Created by\", \"<macroporous scaffolds,regeneration of new tissue>\": \"Created from\", \"<mesoporous materials,cancer therapy>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Amplify and ligation the promoter sequence (BB1635), N20 sequence, tracrRNA sequence, and terminator sequence (BB1636) required for constructing the guide RNA (gRNA) . Subsequently, the obtained fragments were subjected to Gibson Assembly with pCfB3405 digested by AsiS I enzyme and the resulting reaction products were directly transformed into DH5α. The confirmation was conducted through Sanger sequencing, thus yielding a gRNA (pCfB3405-gAXP) targeting knockout site of AXP. Using pCfB3405-gAXP as a template, the N20 sequence was replaced to obtain a gRNA (pCfB3405-gXPR2) targeting knockout site of XPR2. The various repair templates for the knockout sites were generated by amplifying approximately 600 bp fragments upstream and downstream of the target sites, followed by their ligation. The respective gRNA and DNA repair templates were co-transformed into the starting strain, followed by the selection on YPD agar plates containing nourseothricin. The positive clones were further confirmed by using colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"CRISPR-Cas9\": \"Reactant\", \"genes AXP and XPR2\": \"Reactant\", \"acid extracellular protease (AXP)\": \"Reactant\", \"alkaline extracellular protease (AEP)\": \"Reactant\", \"guide RNA (gRNA)\": \"Reactant\", \"Gibson Assembly\": \"Reaction\", \"AsiS I enzyme\": \"Catalyst\", \"DH5α\": \"Reactant\", \"Sanger sequencing\": \"Condition\", \"YPD agar plates\": \"Condition\", \"nourseothricin\": \"Reactant\", \"colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<genes AXP and XPR2,acid extracellular protease (AXP)>\": \"Created from\", \"<genes AXP and XPR2,alkaline extracellular protease (AEP)>\": \"Created from\", \"<guide RNA (gRNA),Gibson Assembly>\": \"Used in\", \"<Gibson Assembly,AsiS I enzyme>\": \"Created by\", \"<AsiS I enzyme,DH5α>\": \"Used in\", \"<DH5α,Sanger sequencing>\": \"Used in\", \"<Sanger sequencing,YPD agar plates>\": \"Along with\", \"<YPD agar plates,nourseothricin>\": \"Used in\", \"<nourseothricin,colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR)>\": \"Used in\", \"<colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR),Sanger sequencing>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Briefly, to activate MP-NPs, the heterobifunctional cross linker of NHS-PEG5000-MAL (16 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and mixed with nanoparticle suspension (100 mg) at a molar ratio of 2:1 based on previous work . The mixture was incubated with shaking (550 rpm) for 1 h at room temperature. Then the activated MP-NPs were purified by two cycles of ultra-centrifugation at 15,000g for 8 min to remove un-reacted NHS-PEG5000-MAL. The pellet was then re-dispersed in 1 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated with NEP1-40 peptide (870 μg) at a molar ratio of 1:1 for 1 h with stirring (600 rpm); this molar ratio was based on a previous report that the terminal cysteine (Cys) of NEP1-40 reacts with maleimide in a molar ratio of 1:1 . To remove excess small molecules, the reaction solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000g through an ultrafiltration centrifuge tube with molecular weight cutoff at 30 kDa.

The main phase has the lattice parameter a=5.1222 Å and the minor phase a=5.1450 Å. These values are compared with the reported value a=5.12 Å for polycrystalline samples synthesized at 600–700 °C (ref. 4) and 5.1394 Å for single crystals synthesized at temperatures up to 1,100 °C (ref. 6). The phase splitting is most likely due to different Sr deficiencies in some part of the sample, as Sr partially evaporates during the reaction. In addition, a very small amount of Sn and other impurity phases containing Sr are present (marked with asterisks in Fig. 1). These features in X-ray diffraction are common in other batches. All the samples showing superconductivity had Sr deficiency, either caused by significant Sr evaporation during synthesis or by Sr-deficient starting composition (see Methods section). As stoichiometric Sr3SnO does not show superconductivity, we conclude that a deficiency of strontium leads to superconductivity in this compound.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Sr3−xSnO\": \"Reactant\", \"a=5.1222 Å\": \"Condition\", \"a=5.1450 Å\": \"Condition\", \"600–700 °C\": \"Condition\", \"1,100 °C\": \"Condition\", \"reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"Sr deficiencies\": \"Condition\", \"superconductivity\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Sr3−xSnO,a=5.1222 Å>\": \"Created by\", \"<Sr3−xSnO,a=5.1450 Å>\": \"Created by\", \"<reaction,Sr deficiencies>\": \"Created from\", \"<superconductivity,Sr deficiencies>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

A quick survey of four specific municipalities, showed that the incinerators do not even accept construction and demolition waste. As such, 0% of wood waste is assumed to be incinerated in the model. However, in order to consider incineration either for additional regions outside of Canada or to investigate the impacts of potential incineration in Canada, incineration has been left as a waste management option in the model. The carbon emitted by the incinerator is modelled in this work to be mostly CO2 (99.999905%) with a negligible amount of CH4 (0.000095%) . Since the heat created by incinerators can be harnessed for energy purposes, some incinerators generate usable electricity or heat. If desired, this could be accounted for separately.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"incineration\": \"Reaction\", \"waste management\": \"Condition\", \"CO2\": \"Inorganic\", \"CH4\": \"Inorganic\", \"electricity\": \"Reactant\", \"heat\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<incineration,waste management>\": \"Used in\", \"<CO2,incineration>\": \"Created from\", \"<CH4,incineration>\": \"Created from\", \"<electricity,incineration>\": \"Created from\", \"<heat,incineration>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Here, the protein expression level was determined as the total amount of the soluble and insoluble forms of ADO, while solubility was estimated as the ratio of the amount of the soluble form to the total amount of the soluble and insoluble forms of ADO. We found that solubility was highest for TeADO (88%), followed by, in descending order, 9443ADO, 7336ADO, 7942ADO, 9313ADO, PaADO, 6803ADO, 7425ADO, 73102ADO, and 7421ADO (Fig. 3b). The high solubility of TeADO may be explained by the fact that proteins derived from thermophilic bacteria have high stability . In contrast, the solubility of 7421ADO was lowest (70%). This may be due to the significantly high expression level of the 7421ADO protein (Fig. 3c). Nonetheless, the amount of the soluble form of 7421ADO, which corresponds to the product of the protein expression level and solubility, was highest among the ADOs (Fig. 3a).","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"solubility\": \"Condition\", \"protein expression levels\": \"Condition\", \"ADOs\": \"Reactant\", \"TeADO\": \"Reactant\", \"thermophilic bacteria\": \"Organic\", \"7421ADO\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<solubility,ADOs>\": \"Created by\", \"<protein expression levels,ADOs>\": \"Created by\", \"<7421ADO,solubility>\": \"Created by\", \"<7421ADO,protein expression levels>\": \"Created by\", \"<TeADO,solubility>\": \"Created by\", \"<thermophilic bacteria,TeADO>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The pressure is higher than this reference value at the cathode and lower at the anode, regardless of the presence of non-idealities (Figs. 3e, f, 4e, f). For lithium membranes, we observe an increase in the difference of pressure with respect to the reference configuration when considering non-idealities (21% at the cathode and 40% at the anode), which also widen the boundary layers (Fig. 3e, f). When considering cesium membranes with non-idealities, we register a smaller peak pressure difference in the boundary layers compared to the ideal case (Fig. 4e, f), with a 39% reduction at the cathode and 33% at the anode. Such a decrease is accompanied by a smaller rate of change in the profile and thicker boundary layers compared to ideality.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"pressure\": \"Condition\", \"non-idealities\": \"Condition\", \"lithium membranes\": \"Reactant\", \"cesium membranes\": \"Reactant\", \"boundary layers\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<pressure,lithium membranes>\": \"Created by\", \"<pressure,cesium membranes>\": \"Created by\", \"<non-idealities,lithium membranes>\": \"Used in\", \"<non-idealities,cesium membranes>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

In our previous work , the reliability of PGE as a novel IOL bulk material was verified. After AuNPs@MIL was doped into the IOL bulk material PGE, the MIL structure could not only prevent the inevitable agglomeration during the preparation of AuNPs but also prevent the deactivation caused by protein adsorption. And when MIL is used as a carrier platform to deliver AuNPs, it can also participate in the cascade reaction after its self-degradation and inhibit PCO through multiple pathways. In conclusion, the present research design takes full advantage of the unique properties of AuNPs to demonstrate the success of preventing PCO through cascade reactions and PTT in vivo/in vitro experiments. This strategy realizes the effective combination of short-term postoperative automatic prevention and long-term manual intervenability, which is expected to achieve effective prevention of PCO for an extended period after cataract surgery in the clinic.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"AuNPs@MIL\": \"Reactant\", \"poly (glycidyl methacrylate)-co-2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethyl acrylate (PGE)\": \"Reactant\", \"radical polymerization\": \"Reaction\", \"protein adsorption\": \"Condition\", \"cascade reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"PCO\": \"Reactant\", \"PTT\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<AuNPs@MIL,poly (glycidyl methacrylate)-co-2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethyl acrylate (PGE)>\": \"Used in\", \"<radical polymerization,AuNPs@MIL>\": \"Created from\", \"<protein adsorption,AuNPs@MIL>\": \"Created by\", \"<cascade reaction,AuNPs@MIL>\": \"Used in\", \"<PCO,cascade reaction>\": \"Created from\", \"<PTT,AuNPs@MIL>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

It was found that proper amount of Fe could enhance the dispersion of NiO, improve the reducibility, and change the pore distribution. In consequence, the low-temperature activity was also significantly improved. The reaction started at 200 °C using 0.05 Fe–Ni–Al2O3-HT catalyst, which was 50 °C lower than that using Ni–Al2O3-HT catalyst without modification. And the CH4 selectivity could reach 100.0 % at 362 °C at the CO2 conversion of 96.8 %. The catalyst was also modified with Mg to enhance the adsorption capacity of CO2. And it showed the same effect for the dispersion of NiO. But, the catalyst became difficult to be reduced and had no obvious improvement in the pore distribution. What is more, the catalytic activity of the catalyst modified with Mg at low temperature was lower than the one modified with Fe.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Ni–Al-hydrotalcite-derived catalyst\": \"Catalyst\", \"Fe\": \"Catalyst\", \"Mg\": \"Catalyst\", \"CO2 methanation\": \"Reaction\", \"low temperature\": \"Condition\", \"reaction activity\": \"Reaction\", \"dispersion of NiO\": \"Condition\", \"reducibility\": \"Condition\", \"pore distribution\": \"Condition\", \"CH4 selectivity\": \"Condition\", \"CO2 conversion\": \"Condition\", \"adsorption capacity of CO2\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Ni–Al-hydrotalcite-derived catalyst,CO2 methanation>\": \"Used in\", \"<Fe,reaction activity>\": \"Used in\", \"<Mg,reaction activity>\": \"Used in\", \"<low temperature,reaction activity>\": \"Along with\", \"<dispersion of NiO,reaction activity>\": \"Created by\", \"<reducibility,reaction activity>\": \"Created by\", \"<pore distribution,reaction activity>\": \"Created by\", \"<CH4 selectivity,CO2 conversion>\": \"Created from\", \"<adsorption capacity of CO2,CO2 methanation>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Hydrolysis of HMT and the subsequent reaction with water generate OH− shown as Eq. (1)–(2). As the concentration of Zn2+ and OH− ions exceeds a critical value, the precipitation of Zn(OH)2 starts (Eq. (3)). Then the hydrolysis of Zn(OH)2 produces ZnO molecules (Eq. (4)). Aggregation of ZnO molecules would form ZnO nuclei. ZnO nuclei are the building blocks for growth of ZnO microrods. Due to crystal habits of ZnO, the nuclei have a hexagonal shape. In the hexagonal wurtzite phase, the ZnO has polar and non-polar faces. In polar ZnO crystals, the zinc and oxygen atoms are arranged alternately along the c-axis, and the top-end surfaces are Zn-terminated (0001) and are catalytically active, while the bottom surfaces are O-terminated (000-1) and are chemically inert . As an amphoteric oxide, ZnO can react with both H+ and OH− ions, and the products are soluble salts. Thus, as the pH value changes in the solution due to temperature changing, selective etching of ZnO microrods forms the sharp tip on the top end.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Zn(NO3)2\": \"Reactant\", \"Zn2+\": \"Reactant\", \"OH−\": \"Reactant\", \"Zn(OH)2\": \"Reactant\", \"ZnO\": \"Reactant\", \"HMT\": \"Reactant\", \"water\": \"Solvent\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"pH value\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Zn(NO3)2,Zn2+>\": \"Created from\", \"<Zn2+,Zn(OH)2>\": \"Created from\", \"<Zn(OH)2,ZnO>\": \"Created from\", \"<ZnO,HMT>\": \"Used in\", \"<HMT,water>\": \"Used in\", \"<water,pH value>\": \"Along with\", \"<pH value,temperature>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

The structure and chemical composition of the as-synthesized BNNTs are extensively characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and selected-area electron diffraction. The cylinder-shaped BNNTs have an average diameter of about 100 nm and length of hundreds of microns, while the bamboo-shaped BNNTs are 100–500 nm in diameter with length up to tens of microns. The formation mechanism of the BNNTs has been explored on the basis of our experimental observations and a growth model has been proposed accordingly. Ultraviolet–visible and cathodoluminescence spectroscopic analyses are performed on the BNNTs. Strong ultraviolet emissions are detected on both morphologies of BNNTs. The band gap of the BNNTs are around 5.82 eV and nearly unaffected by tube morphology.

Four types of carbon nanotubes with the outside diameters from 15 to 80 nm and the lengths from 1.5 to 10 μm were used in the experiments. The refrigerants include R113, R141b and n-pentane. The oil concentration is from 0 to 10 wt.%, the heat flux is from 10 to 100 kW·m-2, and the initial liquid-level height is from 1.3 to 3.4 cm. The experimental results indicate that the migration ratio of carbon nanotube increases with the increase of the outside diameter or the length of carbon nanotube. For the fixed type of carbon nanotube, the migration ratio decreases with the increase of the oil concentration or the heat flux, and increases with the increase of the initial liquid-level height. The migration ratio of carbon nanotube increases with the decrease of dynamic viscosity of refrigerant or the increase of liquid phase density of refrigerant. A model for predicting the migration ratio of carbon nanotubes in the refrigerant-based nanofluid pool boiling is proposed, and the predictions agree with 92% of the experimental data within a deviation of ±20%.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"carbon nanotubes\": \"Reactant\", \"refrigerant-based nanofluid pool boiling\": \"Reaction\", \"outside diameters\": \"Condition\", \"lengths\": \"Condition\", \"oil concentration\": \"Condition\", \"heat flux\": \"Condition\", \"initial liquid-level height\": \"Condition\", \"dynamic viscosity of refrigerant\": \"Condition\", \"liquid phase density of refrigerant\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<carbon nanotubes,outside diameters>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon nanotubes,lengths>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon nanotubes,oil concentration>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon nanotubes,heat flux>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon nanotubes,initial liquid-level height>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon nanotubes,dynamic viscosity of refrigerant>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon nanotubes,liquid phase density of refrigerant>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Previous studies have cloned and identified ALASs from a variety of species and used them for the construction of 5-ALA producing strains. However, most of the natural ALAS suffers from low catalytic efficiency and/or serious feedback inhibition by heme , which would limit their practical application in bioproduction of 5-ALA (Zhang et al. ). Tan et al. obtained two R. palustris ALAS variants (H29R and H15K) with moderately enhanced thermostability and released feedback inhibition via computer-aided rational enzyme engineering. However, overexpression of the mutants only slightly improved 5-ALA production . In this study, combining l-cysteine substitution and activity recovery mutations successfully produced an ALAS mutant with higher catalytic activity and significantly released feedback inhibition. Besides, overexpression of this mutant supported high-level 5-ALA production.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ALAS\": \"Catalyst\", \"5-ALA\": \"Reactant\", \"l-cysteine\": \"Reactant\", \"heme\": \"Reactant\", \"R. palustris ALAS variants\": \"Catalyst\", \"mutants\": \"Catalyst\", \"mutant\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ALAS,5-ALA>\": \"Used in\", \"<l-cysteine,mutant>\": \"Created from\", \"<heme,ALAS>\": \"Created by\", \"<R. palustris ALAS variants,5-ALA>\": \"Used in\", \"<mutants,5-ALA>\": \"Used in\", \"<mutant,5-ALA>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Pigment Red 115 was detected along with alizarin also in the paint tube T17 “Lac Carmineé fixe”. The identification was based on the interpretation of the UV–Vis spectrum, high resolution mass spectrum and tandem mass spectrum of the peak in the chromatogram . Sample F5 (“Assiette à Dorer Rouge vif. 1914”) contained a pigment with molecular formula C20H14O4N2S, consistent with Acid Red 88 or Acid Red 9 (both synthesised in 1877), or Acid Brown 6 (synthesised 1878). AR88 was excluded by comparison with a standard, and it was not possible to assign the compound to either AR9 or AB6 .

Microplastics are a diverse contaminant suite comprised of many polymer types, sizes, and shapes  with more than 10,000 added chemicals , of which some may drive toxicity in humans and in ecological receptors . Understanding the relative toxicity of each of these components allows for strategies to reduce the input of the most harmful materials into the environment through safer-by-design regulatory frameworks as well as bans and reduction targets . To inform these management efforts, Hampton et al.  performed a meta-analysis to identify physical characteristics of microplastics that are most important for toxicity, finding that size is a critical factor, and Peters et al.  used human physiological in vitro models in combination with analytical chemistry to identify hazardous chemicals associated with environmental microplastics.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"microplastics\": \"Reactant\", \"toxicity\": \"Condition\", \"size\": \"Condition\", \"chemicals\": \"Reactant\", \"environment\": \"Condition\", \"analytical chemistry\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<microplastics,toxicity>\": \"Created from\", \"<size,microplastics>\": \"Created by\", \"<chemicals,environment>\": \"Used in\", \"<analytical chemistry,chemicals>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Controlling absolute band edge positions is an important design criterion for a large variety of potential solid-state and colloidal QD applications. We found that IE (Φ) of our ligand/QD complex library ranges from 6.2 (5.4) eV for the 4-CF3-CA−/QD complex to 4.1 (3.0) eV for the 4-N(CH3)2-CA−/QD complex. For comparison, we fabricated other PbS ligand/QD thin films that have been studied previously, following layer-by-layer film fabrication procedures as specified in the literature using a similar PbS QD system14,16,17. We found good agreement between the XPS band edge values we measured and those reported elsewhere, giving us confidence that our R-CA−/QD complex library induces the deepest and shallowest absolute band edges for PbS QD thin films, to date (Supplementary Fig. 9).","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"PbS QD thin films\": \"Reactant\", \"ligand dipole\": \"Condition\", \"band edge shifting\": \"Reaction\", \"IE (Φ)\": \"Condition\", \"4-CF3-CA−/QD complex\": \"Reactant\", \"4-N(CH3)2-CA−/QD complex\": \"Reactant\", \"R-CA−/QD complex library\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<PbS QD thin films,ligand dipole>\": \"Created by\", \"<4-CF3-CA−/QD complex,IE (Φ)>\": \"Created from\", \"<4-N(CH3)2-CA−/QD complex,IE (Φ)>\": \"Created from\", \"<R-CA−/QD complex library,PbS QD thin films>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Optimisation of ligand substituents and the reaction conditions was conducted. The enantiomeric excess of the formed products was highest when alkyl aldehydes were employed in the reaction (>99% e.e.). The absolute stereochemistry of one representative azetidine derivative salt was determined by analysis of the Flack parameter of an XRD single crystal structure. The origin of selectivity in catalysis was investigated computationally, revealing the importance of the amino-substituent in determining the stereochemical outcome. A racemic platinum complex of a cis-disubstituted azetidine is examined by XRD single crystal structure analysis with reference to its steric parameters, and analogies to the computationally determined copper complex catalyst are drawn. A preliminary example of the use of a cis-disubstituted azetidine scaffold in thiourea H-bonding catalyst is noted in the supporting information.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"2,4-cis-disubstituted amino azetidines\": \"Reactant\", \"copper-catalysed Henry reactions\": \"Reaction\", \"aldehydes\": \"Organic\", \"nitromethane\": \"Organic\", \"ligand substituents\": \"Condition\", \"reaction conditions\": \"Condition\", \"alkyl aldehydes\": \"Organic\", \"azetidine derivative salt\": \"Reactant\", \"amino-substituent\": \"Reactant\", \"cis-disubstituted azetidine\": \"Reactant\", \"thiourea H-bonding catalyst\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<2,4-cis-disubstituted amino azetidines,copper-catalysed Henry reactions>\": \"Used in\", \"<alkyl aldehydes,copper-catalysed Henry reactions>\": \"Used in\", \"<azetidine derivative salt,amino-substituent>\": \"Created from\", \"<cis-disubstituted azetidine,thiourea H-bonding catalyst>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Nonetheless, they are applied/cited extensively in electrolyte papers.Fig. 1The ideality requirement of electrolyte is not met at practical salt concentrations.The electrolyte ideality can only be approximately approached at extremely diluted solutions (<0.01 M); at concentrations above 0.01 M, the cations and anions are so strongly interacting with each other that ion-pairs form; at moderate concentrations (0.01–0.5 M) solvent-separated ions (SSIP) and close ion-pairs (CIP) coexist; at super-concentrations (>5 M), the aggregates (AGG) and nano-heterogeneity arise and constitute the extended solution structures.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"electrolytes\": \"Reactant\", \"salt concentrations\": \"Condition\", \"ionic current\": \"Condition\", \"cell reactions\": \"Reaction\", \"equations\": \"Condition\", \"solutions\": \"Solvent\", \"cations\": \"Inorganic\", \"anions\": \"Inorganic\", \"ion-pairs\": \"Reactant\", \"solvent-separated ions\": \"Reactant\", \"close ion-pairs\": \"Reactant\", \"aggregates\": \"Reactant\", \"nano-heterogeneity\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<electrolytes,salt concentrations>\": \"Created by\", \"<ionic current,cell reactions>\": \"Used in\", \"<equations,solutions>\": \"Used in\", \"<solutions,cations>\": \"Created from\", \"<solutions,anions>\": \"Created from\", \"<solutions,ion-pairs>\": \"Created from\", \"<solutions,solvent-separated ions>\": \"Created from\", \"<solutions,close ion-pairs>\": \"Created from\", \"<solutions,aggregates>\": \"Created from\", \"<solutions,nano-heterogeneity>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The UV radiation is capable of photochemically degrading the polymer structure components of wood (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) . The photodegradation process usually results in reduced water resistance of wood and wood-based materials which lead to further biodegradation under outdoor exposure conditions. The intense damage to materials due to the UV component in solar radiation can be prevented by using light-stabilisation technologies, surface coatings or by replacing these materials with materials that are more resistant against UV radiation . Nanoparticles can be utilised to improve the UV resistance for solvent, waterborne and UV coatings in order to protect the wood surfaces. Nanoparticles that contain functional coatings to achieve UV-blocking properties offer a high level of protection against UV without affecting the transparency of the surface. The small size of the nanoparticles gives a significant increase in effectiveness of blocking UV light compared to natural material due to their large surface area-to-volume ratio.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"wood\": \"Reactant\", \"solar light\": \"Condition\", \"UV radiation\": \"Condition\", \"polymer structure components\": \"Reactant\", \"water\": \"Solvent\", \"Nanoparticles\": \"Catalyst\", \"light-stabilisation technologies\": \"Condition\", \"surface coatings\": \"Condition\", \"waterborne and UV coatings\": \"Solvent\", \"functional coatings\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<wood,solar light>\": \"Created by\", \"<polymer structure components,UV radiation>\": \"Created from\", \"<water,Nanoparticles>\": \"Used in\", \"<Nanoparticles,functional coatings>\": \"Created from\", \"<light-stabilisation technologies,wood>\": \"Used in\", \"<surface coatings,wood>\": \"Used in\", \"<waterborne and UV coatings,wood>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Compared with chemical processing, bioprocessing with microbial and enzymatic catalysis is a clean and efficient method for lignin depolymerization and conversion. Generally, lignin bioprocessing involves lignin decomposition to lignin-based aromatics via extracellular microbial enzymes and further converted to value-added bioproducts through microbial metabolism. In the review, the most recent advances in degradation and conversion of lignin to value-added bioproducts catalyzed by microbes and enzymes were summarized. The lignin-degrading microorganisms of white-rot fungi, brown-rot fungi, soft-rot fungi, and bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were comparatively analyzed. The catalytic metabolism of the microbial lignin-degrading enzymes of laccase, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, biphenyl bond cleavage enzyme, versatile peroxidase, and β-etherize was discussed. The microbial metabolic process of H-lignin, G-lignin, S-lignin based derivatives, protocatechuic acid, and catechol was reviewed. Lignin was depolymerized to lignin-derived aromatic compounds by the secreted enzymes of fungi and bacteria, and the aromatics were converted to value-added compounds through microbial catalysis and metabolic engineering. The review also proposes new insights for future work to overcome the recalcitrance of lignin and convert it to value-added bioproducts by microbial and enzymatic catalysis.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"microbial and enzymatic catalysis\": \"Catalyst\", \"lignin bioprocessing\": \"Reaction\", \"extracellular microbial enzymes\": \"Catalyst\", \"white-rot fungi\": \"Organic\", \"brown-rot fungi\": \"Organic\", \"soft-rot fungi\": \"Organic\", \"bacteria\": \"Organic\", \"aerobic and anaerobic conditions\": \"Condition\", \"H-lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"G-lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"S-lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"protocatechuic acid\": \"Reactant\", \"catechol\": \"Reactant\", \"fungi\": \"Organic\", \"biphenyl bond cleavage enzyme\": \"Catalyst\", \"versatile peroxidase\": \"Catalyst\", \"β-etherize\": \"Catalyst\", \"laccase\": \"Catalyst\", \"lignin peroxidase\": \"Catalyst\", \"manganese peroxidase\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Lignin,microbial and enzymatic catalysis>\": \"Used in\", \"<Lignin,H-lignin>\": \"Created from\", \"<Lignin,G-lignin>\": \"Created from\", \"<Lignin,S-lignin>\": \"Created from\", \"<Lignin,protoctatechuic acid>\": \"Created from\", \"<Lignin,catechol>\": \"Created from\", \"<lignin bioprocessing,extracellular microbial enzymes>\": \"Used in\", \"<fungi,biphenyl bond cleavage enzyme>\": \"Used in\", \"<fungi,versatile peroxidase>\": \"Used in\", \"<fungi,β-etherize>\": \"Used in\", \"<fungi,laccase>\": \"Used in\", \"<fungi,lignin peroxidase>\": \"Used in\", \"<fungi,manganese peroxidase>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

However, little is known about the effects of highly ionizing soft X-rays. By combining monochromatized synchrotron source irradiation with in situ Near Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (in the mbar range), and using the synoptic view encompassing both the gas and condensed phases, we found the water and pyridine pressure conditions under which pyridine is decomposed in the presence of synthetic Sr2+-hydroxyhectorite. The formation of a pyridine/water/Sr2+ complex, detected from the Sr 3d and N 1s core-level binding energies, likely presents a favorable situation for the radiolytic breaking of the O-H bond of water molecules adsorbed in the clay and the subsequent decomposition of the molecule. However, decomposition stops when the pyridine pressure exceeds a critical value. This observation can be related to a change in the nature of the active radical species with the pyridine loading. This highlights the fact that the destruction of the molecule is not entirely determined by the properties of the host material, but also by the inserted organic species. The physical and chemical causes of the present observations are discussed.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"organic molecules\": \"Organic\", \"soft X-rays\": \"Condition\", \"water\": \"Reactant\", \"pyridine\": \"Reactant\", \"synthetic Sr2+-hydroxyhectorite\": \"Reactant\", \"O-H bond\": \"Reactant\", \"active radical species\": \"Reactant\", \"host material\": \"Reactant\", \"organic species\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<organic molecules,soft X-rays>\": \"Created by\", \"<water,pyridine>\": \"Used in\", \"<pyridine,synthetic Sr2+-hydroxyhectorite>\": \"Used in\", \"<synthetic Sr2+-hydroxyhectorite,O-H bond>\": \"Created from\", \"<O-H bond,active radical species>\": \"Created from\", \"<active radical species,host material>\": \"Used in\", \"<host material,organic species>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Especially, the concentration of SI was vigorously increased in the stationary phase (12–48 h). This may be due to cells being well maintained in the stationary phase by nutrient(s) included in Bacto soytone. However, even concentration of Bacto soytone was increased to 8% (w/v), the conversion efficiency was not improved compared with that in 4% (w/v) Bacto soytone medium in strain KU303 (data not shown). Instead, the final optical density at 600 nm (OD600) in 8% (w/v) Bacto soytone medium reached to 25.4, which was almost twice higher than that in 4% (w/v) Bacto soytone medium.

Due to their controllable diffusion kinetics and efficient confinement of redox centers, nano-MOFs can be utilized in novel applications where a specific size and shape are required (e.g., sulfur storage for energy conversion applications)13,14. The synthesis of MOFs can be tuned by carefully choosing the metal and organic components to generate typically tens to hundreds of micron-sized large and continuous crystals with extremely uniform structures and homogenous properties (e.g., pore metrics, chemical compositions, and adsorption profiles)15. Although the pore metrics of the frameworks may be altered by modulating the length or shape of the organic linkers, growth conditions or the presence of additives during nucleation16, challenges associated with limiting MOF crystal growth to the nanoscale regime have hindered their scope of application17. Several downsizing techniques that bring MOFs into the nanodomain were shown to offer routes to amplify the natural properties of the MOFs by refining their surface-to-volume ratio and by generating increased volumetric densities of terminal or defective sites17,18.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"MOF crystals\": \"Reactant\", \"redox centers\": \"Reactant\", \"metal and organic components\": \"Reactant\", \"organic linkers\": \"Reactant\", \"growth conditions\": \"Condition\", \"additives\": \"Reactant\", \"nanoscale regime\": \"Condition\", \"surface-to-volume ratio\": \"Condition\", \"volumetric densities\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<MOF crystals,redox centers>\": \"Created from\", \"<metal and organic components,MOF crystals>\": \"Used in\", \"<organic linkers,growth conditions>\": \"Along with\", \"<additives,nanoscale regime>\": \"Used in\", \"<surface-to-volume ratio,volumetric densities>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Most importantly, theoretical considerations and field measurements are combined provide the first direct evidence that Cd distribution and isotopic fractionation in sphalerite, which are strongly dependent on the Cd source and the geochemical conditions of the ore-forming fluid (temperature, ΣSred activities, pH and salinity), can be used as potential geochemical proxies to classify the corresponding Pb-Zn deposits.Figure 6Distribution of Zn/Cd ratios versus Cd isotopic compositions in different mineralization systems.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Cd\": \"Inorganic\", \"Pb-Zn deposits\": \"Reactant\", \"Zn/Cd ratios\": \"Condition\", \"geochemical conditions\": \"Condition\", \"sphalerite\": \"Reactant\", \"ore-forming fluid\": \"Reactant\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"ΣSred activities\": \"Condition\", \"pH\": \"Condition\", \"salinity\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Cd,Pb-Zn deposits>\": \"Created from\", \"<geochemical conditions,sphalerite>\": \"Created by\", \"<temperature,sphalerite>\": \"Along with\", \"<ΣSred activities,sphalerite>\": \"Along with\", \"<pH,sphalerite>\": \"Along with\", \"<salinity,sphalerite>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

We found that the similar formation energies aggregated locally to form cluster-like patterns rather than sparse spot-like distributions in Fig. 3. These aggregated clustered patterns intuitively show that the constitution elements with close atom numbers normally form perovskite oxides with similar stability. In addition, except for a few cases, most of the aggregated clusters exhibit diagonal symmetry, indicating that similar stability can be achieved if the substitution elements are swapped between A and B sites. Specifically, rare earth elements are major constitute components that can stabilize perovskite oxides.Fig. 3Heat map of formation energies of 5329 ABO3 perovskite oxide structures predicted by the transferred learning model in this work, containing 73 constitution elements at the A and B sites, respectively, sorted by the atom number.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"formation energies\": \"Condition\", \"constitution elements\": \"Reactant\", \"perovskite oxides\": \"Reactant\", \"atom numbers\": \"Condition\", \"rare earth elements\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<constitution elements,perovskite oxides>\": \"Created from\", \"<atom numbers,perovskite oxides>\": \"Created by\", \"<rare earth elements,perovskite oxides>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Nigeria is ranked ninth in the world amongst the leading citrus producing countries and first in Africa, producing 3.33 million tons of citrus fruits (The Daily Records 2018). Despite this high rank, the country’s local production of essential oil and pectin is very low, as nearly 100% of the essential oils and pectin utilized by the various industries are imported. This is due to lack of appropriate and adequate data. This study therefore employs response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the oil and pectin extraction process parameters. Development of mathematical models would be useful in predicting the responses during the essential oil and pectin extraction processes at different processing conditions, while the characterization of the essential oil and pectin at the optimum processing conditions will provide a true reflection of the quality, suitability, and potential of the extracted essential oil and pectin.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"essential oil\": \"Reactant\", \"pectin\": \"Reactant\", \"oil and pectin extraction process\": \"Reaction\", \"processing conditions\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<essential oil,oil and pectin extraction process>\": \"Created from\", \"<pectin,oil and pectin extraction process>\": \"Created from\", \"<processing conditions,oil and pectin extraction process>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Besides, it permits a continuous run of the fermentation process. Hydrolysis by cellulase occurs efficiently at a temperature range of 45–50 °C, while fermentation by microbes occurs at temperatures of 30–37 °C, resulting in ethanol production . Nevertheless, the end products (glucose and cellobiose) inhibit the activity of the cellulase enzyme and require more time to run the process . β-glucosidase is inhibited by glucose, which elevates the level of cellobiose. Cellobiose subsequently inhibits cellulase, thereby reducing its efficiency . Furthermore, SHF is a two-step process that incurs additional cost, and it is time-consuming.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"hydrolysis\": \"Reaction\", \"fermentation\": \"Reaction\", \"yeast\": \"Reactant\", \"cellulase\": \"Catalyst\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"ethanol\": \"Reactant\", \"glucose\": \"Reactant\", \"cellobiose\": \"Reactant\", \"β-glucosidase\": \"Catalyst\", \"SHF\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<hydrolysis,temperature>\": \"Along with\", \"<fermentation,yeast>\": \"Used in\", \"<cellulase,temperature>\": \"Along with\", \"<ethanol,fermentation>\": \"Created from\", \"<glucose,β-glucosidase>\": \"Created from\", \"<cellobiose,β-glucosidase>\": \"Created from\", \"<SHF,hydrolysis>\": \"Created by\", \"<SHF,fermentation>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The experimental synthesis of large, pure, high-quality MnBi2Te4 single crystals suitable for magnetotransport measurements is however notoriously difficult. Different experiments have confirmed that MnBi2Te4 is a metastable phase that can only be synthesized within a narrow temperature range below 873 K3,13–15. Without a fundamental understanding of its metastability, the ideal growth conditions for pure, large crystal synthesis will remain elusive, ultimately preventing further experimental study of its unique topological and magnetotransport properties. Furthermore, although there have been a significant number of materials predicted to host interesting topological properties16–18, using different symmetry indicators16–19, there are only a handful of experimental realizations of such predictions16–18,20. Hence, the understanding of the metastability of MnBi2Te4 is also highly desirable for the synthesis of other candidate layered topological materials.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"MnBi2Te4\": \"Reactant\", \"MnTe\": \"Reactant\", \"Bi2Te3\": \"Reactant\", \"spin–orbit coupling (SOC)\": \"Condition\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"synthesis\": \"Reaction\", \"metastability\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<MnBi2Te4,MnTe>\": \"Created from\", \"<MnBi2Te4,Bi2Te3>\": \"Created from\", \"<synthesis,temperature>\": \"Along with\", \"<metastability,synthesis>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Both test compounds qualify as difficult-to-test due to their very low solubility. n_Hexylcyclohexane may be considered even more challenging due to its volatility. This study also reaffirms that difficult-to-test substances are just that, presenting a significant challenge even to laboratories experienced with well-established water solubility techniques, such as the column elution method. Despite having sufficiently sensitive analytical methods and prior experience with trace analysis in environmental media, a portion of the labs produced results, at least initially, which were significantly lower than the overall mean for the respective test compounds. The dodecahydrotriphenylene water solubility results from the single attempt from one of the five labs was ultimately excluded as a statistical outlier. This occurred despite the generator column technique being a well-established method dating back to several decades to at least 1978  and thoroughly described in the regulatory test guideline dated 1995 .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"slow-stir method\": \"Reaction\", \"n-hexylcyclohexane\": \"Organic\", \"water\": \"Solvent\", \"generator column\": \"Reaction\", \"dodecahydrotriphenylene\": \"Organic\", \"column elution method\": \"Reaction\", \"environmental media\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<n-hexylcyclohexane,water>\": \"Used in\", \"<dodecahydrotriphenylene,water>\": \"Used in\", \"<column elution method,environmental media>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Results gathered in the present study pointed out the promising cytotoxic activity of the algae extracts in general, S. platensis in particular toward PC3 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. UPLC-MS-based metabolomics approach integrated with multivariate statistical analysis as well as cytotoxic activity testing rapidly uncover the compositional heterogeneity in metabolite profiles of algae extracts in the context of phylum type followed by further discrimination of the samples according to the targeted bioactivity pinpointing the most relevant chemical biomarkers which in turn signifies the importance of marine algae as a source of natural leads. OPLS analysis revealed that unsaturated fatty acids, terpenoids, dipeptides along with polyphenolic compounds being abundantly present in S. platensis were the significant contributors synergistically meditating its prominent anti-proliferative activity. In this context, S. platensis extract, an outstanding store of bioactive molecules, appears to be an extremely important oceanic candidate for future investigations aimed to explore a great scope chemically and biologically.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"metabolomics\": \"Reaction\", \"algae species\": \"Reactant\", \"S. platensis\": \"Reactant\", \"PC3 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells\": \"Reactant\", \"UPLC-MS-based metabolomics approach\": \"Condition\", \"multivariate statistical analysis\": \"Condition\", \"cytotoxic activity testing\": \"Condition\", \"unsaturated fatty acids\": \"Organic\", \"terpenoids\": \"Organic\", \"dipeptides\": \"Organic\", \"polyphenolic compounds\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<S. platensis,PC3 and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<UPLC-MS-based metabolomics approach,S. platensis>\": \"Created by\", \"<multivariate statistical analysis,S. platensis>\": \"Created by\", \"<cytotoxic activity testing,S. platensis>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Among these candidates, 3-D porous aggregates composed of nanoparticles clearly have two outstanding advantages: pores between nanoparticles act both as free spaces to accommodate the volume variations during cycling and as short diffusion paths of Li ions into the nanoparticles . Furthermore, conformal carbon coating onto the nanoparticles is one of the well-known techniques to effectively restrain the volume change during lithiation/delithiation . Such a carbon coating entails the use of disordered carbon while the electronic conductivity is not significant until the carbonization temperature is higher than the temperature when carbothermal reductions of metal oxides start to occur (approximately 600°C) . Alternatively, the flexible graphene, a sp2-hybridized two-dimensional carbon layer is one of the best effective ways to enhance the anode performance of ZnO by providing high electronic conductivity and/or circumventing mechanical stresses during the electrochemical cycling .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ZnO\": \"Reactant\", \"nanoparticles\": \"Reactant\", \"carbon\": \"Organic\", \"graphene\": \"Organic\", \"Li ions\": \"Reactant\", \"metal oxides\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<nanoparticles,ZnO>\": \"Created from\", \"<carbon,nanoparticles>\": \"Used in\", \"<graphene,ZnO>\": \"Used in\", \"<Li ions,nanoparticles>\": \"Used in\", \"<metal oxides,carbon>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Overexpression of genes involved in detoxification of inhibitors could be beneficial for improving yeast tolerance. This study used a rational engineering strategy based on sequential delta homologous integrations of dual expression cassettes, allowing the introduction of several copies into the genome of the yeast. Novel target gene combinations were selected to not only modulate the cell plasma membrane against inhibitor influx, but also to direct intracellular detoxification of inhibitors and strengthen carbon/xylose metabolism. One copy of the FPS1 gene in a xylose-capable (XI) industrial strain S.cerevisiae CelluXTM1 was deleted, whereas the TAL1, PAD1, FDH1, ICT1, ARI1 and ADH6 genes were overexpressed to develop a range of multi-inhibitor-resistant strains.

The ROS responsive polycarbonate was prepared by the ring opening polymerization of cyclic carbonate monomers with ethyl selenide, phenyl selenide or ethyl telluride group. PEG was employed as macro-initiator to prepare amphiphilic block co-polymers, which forms spherical nanoparticles of less than 100 nm. These nanoparticles completely dissociate in the presence of ROS while remain stable in neutral phosphate buffer. To check the ROS responsive drug release potential of these nanoparticles, DOX and Ce6 were loaded. Upon laser irradiation, Ce6 would generate 1O2 which will trigger the degradation of the nanoparticle resulting in the faster release of DOX. Even though numerous ROS responsive nanoparticles have been reported for biomedical application, there are several challenges needed to be addressed such as the biocompatibility of the ROS sensitive linker used, stability of the linker during circulation and at the normal cells. Since the levels of ROS changes with variations in patients and disease conditions the selection of linkers and carrier should be intensively considered for personalized application.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ROS responsive polycarbonate\": \"Reactant\", \"ring opening polymerization\": \"Reaction\", \"cyclic carbonate monomers\": \"Reactant\", \"ethyl selenide\": \"Reactant\", \"phenyl selenide\": \"Reactant\", \"ethyl telluride group\": \"Reactant\", \"PEG\": \"Reactant\", \"amphiphilic block co-polymers\": \"Reactant\", \"nanoparticles\": \"Reactant\", \"DOX\": \"Reactant\", \"Ce6\": \"Reactant\", \"laser irradiation\": \"Condition\", \"1O2\": \"Reactant\", \"linker\": \"Reactant\", \"disease conditions\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ROS responsive polycarbonate,ring opening polymerization>\": \"Created from\", \"<ring opening polymerization,cyclic carbonate monomers>\": \"Used in\", \"<cyclic carbonate monomers,ethyl selenide>\": \"Created from\", \"<ethyl selenide,phenyl selenide>\": \"Created from\", \"<phenyl selenide,ethyl telluride group>\": \"Created from\", \"<ethyl telluride group,PEG>\": \"Created from\", \"<PEG,amphiphilic block co-polymers>\": \"Created from\", \"<amphiphilic block co-polymers,nanoparticles>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoparticles,DOX>\": \"Created from\", \"<DOX,Ce6>\": \"Created from\", \"<Ce6,laser irradiation>\": \"Used in\", \"<laser irradiation,1O2>\": \"Created from\", \"<1O2,linker>\": \"Created from\", \"<linker,disease conditions>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Three biological replicates of the strain QM9414 and ∆pac1 were cultivated in each case, and samples collected from two different time points of each culture were subjected to transcriptional analysis using the microarray method. The microarray platform used in this study includes probes for the transcripts of approximately 10 000 genes, including genes from the genome versions 2.0 and 1.2 , and for putative novel genes detected in a previous study . Statistical analysis of the differentially expressed genes at different pH and in comparison of the cultures of the ∆pac1 strain and its parental strain was carried out using Limma (R, bioconductor ) with a fold change log2 > 0.4 and a p-value < 0.01 as a threshold.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Avicel cellulose\": \"Reactant\", \"QM9414\": \"Reactant\", \"∆pac1\": \"Reactant\", \"bioreactor\": \"Condition\", \"pH3\": \"Condition\", \"pH4.5\": \"Condition\", \"pH6\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Avicel cellulose,QM9414>\": \"Used in\", \"<QM9414,∆pac1>\": \"Created from\", \"<bioreactor,pH3>\": \"Along with\", \"<bioreactor,pH4.5>\": \"Along with\", \"<bioreactor,pH6>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

This can be observed from the red and blue areas that exist only at graphene matrix in atomic model, corresponding to energy levels of LUMO, LUMO + 1 and HOMO, while disappear in other energy levels in the graphene matrix. Due to the proper distribution of the LUMO and LUMO + 1 all over the heterostructure provided by the graphene layer, it allows the transfer of charges during the excitation states of S3, S4 and S5 with energy barrier less than 4 eV. Thus, it can be said that the localization of LUMO at graphene matrix lead to a better charge transfer from graphene side to ZnO end which results in the reduction of the band gap and the increase of the lifetime of the transporting charge. Consequently, the charge and hole recombination rate is expected to be enhanced.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"HOMO-1\": \"Reactant\", \"HOMO-2\": \"Reactant\", \"graphene matrix\": \"Reactant\", \"LUMO\": \"Reactant\", \"LUMO + 1\": \"Reactant\", \"S3\": \"Reactant\", \"S4\": \"Reactant\", \"S5\": \"Reactant\", \"ZnO\": \"Reactant\", \"charge\": \"Reactant\", \"hole\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<HOMO-1,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<HOMO-2,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<LUMO,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<LUMO + 1,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<S3,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<S4,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<S5,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<ZnO,graphene matrix>\": \"Created from\", \"<charge,ZnO>\": \"Created by\", \"<hole,ZnO>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

However, for such ambiguous microbial species, the complex metabolites and interaction mechanisms are unknown, which limits the effective optimization of conversion from chemical energy to electrical energy in MFCs systems. Moreover, the biological colony structure of mixed cultures is not stable and is easily affected by environmental changes. Therefore, isolating a single strain that can use a cellulose carbon source and generate electricity at the same time is a key breakthrough to improve the MFCs system. At present, it has been reported that Enterobacter cloacae (4.90 ± 0.01 mW m−2) , Cellulomonas fimi (38.70 mW m−2)  and Cellulomonas strain Lsc-8 (9.56 ± 0.37 mW m−2)  have the ability to use cellulose to produce electricity.

In contrast, the MD samples have high concentrations of the most soluble salts, such as NaNO3, and little chemical weathering has taken place. Our ER samples are very close to, and at the same elevations, as a hotspot of lichen diversity described by Green et al.29. This location yielded 28 different lichen species and their occurrence has been attributed to “relicts” that have survived on-site through the glacier maxima periods. These authors suggested that these relict populations at the ER site could be as young as 200 Kyr, but they could be much older as well. Nonetheless, this site is clearly a more suitable habitat for life due to the abundance and/or frequency of liquid water as evidenced by the geochemical information.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"liquid water\": \"Solvent\", \"soluble salts\": \"Reactant\", \"chemical weathering\": \"Reaction\", \"ER site\": \"Condition\", \"lichen diversity\": \"Organic\", \"geochemical information\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<liquid water,soluble salts>\": \"Used in\", \"<soluble salts,chemical weathering>\": \"Created from\", \"<chemical weathering,ER site>\": \"Created by\", \"<ER site,lichen diversity>\": \"Along with\", \"<lichen diversity,geochemical information>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Generally, ester linkages have a pH-dependent hydrolysis with half-life time from hours to days. But the rapid degradation in the blood reduces DNA delivery efficiency because endosomal escape efficiency is reduced due to off-target biodegradability . However, the disulfide bond is stable during blood circulation and its reducible degradation is rapid (minutes to hours) in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) or glutathione mimicking the reductive intracellular environment. Similarly poly(amidoamine) polymers containing disulfide bonds have been investigated for gene delivery, but these polymers have low molecular weight and low nitrogen density, which results in poor DNA condensation and endosomal escape . Therefore, the introduction of disulfide bonds in LMW-PEI provides an outstanding approach to develop an efficient gene carrier, which will not only maintain the amine density in the polymer but also assist the release of DNA in reducing environment of cytosol .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"LMW-PEI\": \"Reactant\", \"ester\": \"Reactant\", \"disulfide linkages\": \"Reactant\", \"pH\": \"Condition\", \"DNA\": \"Reactant\", \"dithiothreitol\": \"Catalyst\", \"glutathione\": \"Catalyst\", \"poly(amidoamine) polymers\": \"Reactant\", \"disulfide bonds\": \"Reactant\", \"cytosol\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<LMW-PEI,dna>\": \"Created from\", \"<ester,pH>\": \"Created by\", \"<disulfide linkages,DNA>\": \"Used in\", \"<dithiothreitol,disulfide linkages>\": \"Used in\", \"<glutathione,disulfide linkages>\": \"Used in\", \"<poly(amidoamine) polymers,DNA>\": \"Created from\", \"<disulfide bonds,cytosol>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Recently, a nonlocal spin injection using polycrystalline CoFeAl was reported. However, the relatively large resistivity of the CoFeAl utilized in Bridoux et al.22 indicates that the crystal structure and the spin polarization are far from those of an ideal Heusler compound (see Supplementary information). In the present study, we show that an epitaxially grown Co-based Heusler compound, Co2FeSi (CFS) with a highly ordered L21 structure, enables the highly efficient injection of pure spin currents.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Co-based Heusler compounds\": \"Reactant\", \"pure spin currents\": \"Reactant\", \"polycrystalline CoFeAl\": \"Reactant\", \"Co2FeSi (CFS)\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {}} "}

The less desirable production route involves neutron irradiation of 141Pr target material (100% natural abundance) by means of the 141Pr(n,γ)142Pr nuclear reaction (σth = 11.49 barns) to produce the intermediate 142Pr isotope, which then undergoes a second neutron capture event via the 142Pr(n,γ)143Pr nuclear reaction, thereby exploiting the higher thermal neutron capture cross-section of the intermediate 142Pr (σth = 20.03 barns) (Knapp and Dash 2016). This method gives the desired 143Pr in carrier-added form and typically results in a significant 142Pr impurity being present, the amount of which is highly dependent upon the irradiation time and the cooling period post-irradiation. Additionally, the compounding of the relatively low thermal neutron capture cross sections for both nuclear reactions culminates in low production yields for this method.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"143Pr\": \"Reactant\", \"141Pr\": \"Reactant\", \"142Pr\": \"Reactant\", \"neutron irradiation\": \"Condition\", \"141Pr(n,γ)142Pr nuclear reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"142Pr(n,γ)143Pr nuclear reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"thermal neutron capture cross-section\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<143Pr,141Pr>\": \"Created from\", \"<141Pr,neutron irradiation>\": \"Used in\", \"<142Pr,143Pr>\": \"Created from\", \"<141Pr(n,γ)142Pr nuclear reaction,142Pr>\": \"Created from\", \"<142Pr(n,γ)143Pr nuclear reaction,143Pr>\": \"Created from\", \"<thermal neutron capture cross-section,142Pr(n,γ)143Pr nuclear reaction>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Therefore, from a kinetic point of view, it would not be expected that they directly gained the enzymes with significantly low activity during evolution. Type-II evolution of ancestral archaea is thus interpreted according to the following plausible scenario: as seen in A2, ancestral archaea without PC would first gain enzymes necessary for a complete oTCA cycle under heterotrophic growing conditions so that they evolved to be heterotrophic anaerobic archaea. Subsequently, the heterotrophic anaerobic archaea would acquire enzymes necessary for a DC/4HB or 3HP/4HB carbon fixation pathway and gain the ability to grow not only heterotrophically but also chemolithoautotrophically, as seen in A3. Notably, V. distributa28 with type-A2 partly possesses enzymes necessary for the DC/4HB carbon fixation pathway. Thus, it might have evolved into a heterotroph from type-A3 and, during the process, possibly lost some of the less active enzymes for the DC/4HP pathway under heterotrophically growing conditions.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"rTCA flux\": \"Reactant\", \"ACOA influx\": \"Reactant\", \"DC/4HB\": \"Reactant\", \"3HP/4HB pathway\": \"Reaction\", \"PC\": \"Reactant\", \"enzymes\": \"Catalyst\", \"oTCA cycle\": \"Reaction\", \"heterotrophic growing conditions\": \"Condition\", \"DC/4HB carbon fixation pathway\": \"Reaction\", \"V. distributa28\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<rTCA flux,ACOA influx>\": \"Created from\", \"<DC/4HB,3HP/4HB pathway>\": \"Used in\", \"<enzymes,oTCA cycle>\": \"Used in\", \"<DC/4HB carbon fixation pathway,V. distributa28>\": \"Created by\", \"<DC/4HB carbon fixation pathway,heterotrophic growing conditions>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

As shown in Fig. 1d, the TaS2 QDs line profile exhibits obvious lattice stripe with a spacing of 0.207 nm. The SEM image in Fig. 1e shows a uniform distribution of TaS2 QDs, thus indicating a good dispersibility and uniform size distribution. At higher SEM magnification, it is apparent that the surface consisted of rugged particles as shown in Fig. 1f. This indicates the formation of independent spherical TaS2 QDs during the preparation process. EDS technique was used to characterize the elemental composition as shown in Fig. 1g. A film of TaS2 QDS was deposited on copper sheet during the EDS characterization in order to avoid the overlapping of Ta and Si/SiO2 substrate peaks, which could complicate the analysis.

AlkB, an integral membrane protein, is an alkane monooxygenase, inserting a single oxygen atom from molecular oxygen into a terminal carbon–hydrogen bond of n-alkanes. The soluble rubredoxin AlkG, which is reduced by the rubredoxin reductase AlkT, is responsible for delivering electrons to AlkB. AlkL is a transporter located in the periplasmic membrane, facilitating uptake of hydrophobic compounds . The alkane degradation genes are split into two clusters, AlkST and AlkBFGHJKL (Fig. 1b). The whole pathway is activated by AlkS controlling the AlkST cluster by the promoter PalkS2 and the AlkBFGHJKL cluster by the promoter PalkB. In P. putida GPO1 the Crc protein inhibits translation of AlkS , AlkB and AlkG mRNAs to repress AlkBGT activity when cells grow on a minimal medium with preferred substrates such as succinate and lactate23, 24.

The process of shortening the lipidic carbon chain is called β-oxidation of fatty acids, while the elongation process is called biosynthesis. Thus, it is possible to infer that in addition to the enzymatic complexes for carrying out the β-oxidation and fatty acid biosynthesis processes, the microorganism L. ramosa synthesizes the desaturase enzyme, responsible for the conversion of saturated to (poly)unsaturated fatty acids.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"saturated fatty acids\": \"Organic\", \"orange waste substrate\": \"Reactant\", \"β-oxidation\": \"Reaction\", \"fatty acid biosynthesis\": \"Reaction\", \"desaturase enzyme\": \"Catalyst\", \"L. ramosa\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<saturated fatty acids,β-oxidation>\": \"Created from\", \"<orange waste substrate,saturated fatty acids>\": \"Created from\", \"<desaturase enzyme,fatty acid biosynthesis>\": \"Used in\", \"<L. ramosa,desaturase enzyme>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

However, the extensive acetylation of hardwood xylan hinders lignocellulose saccharification by obstructing enzymatic xylan hydrolysis and causing inhibitory acetic acid concentrations during microbial sugar fermentation. To optimize lignocellulose for cost-effective saccharification and biofuel production, an acetyl xylan esterase AnAXE1 from Aspergillus niger was introduced into aspen and targeted to cell walls.ResultsAnAXE1-expressing plants exhibited reduced xylan acetylation and grew normally. Without pretreatment, their lignocellulose yielded over 25% more glucose per unit mass of wood (dry weight) than wild-type plants. Glucose yields were less improved (+7%) after acid pretreatment, which hydrolyses xylan. The results indicate that AnAXE1 expression also reduced the molecular weight of xylan, and xylan–lignin complexes and/or lignin co-extracted with xylan, increased cellulose crystallinity, altered the lignin composition, reducing its syringyl to guaiacyl ratio, and increased lignin solubility in dioxane and hot water. Lignin-associated carbohydrates became enriched in xylose residues, indicating a higher content of xylo-oligosaccharides.ConclusionsThis work revealed several changes in plant cell walls caused by deacetylation of xylan. We propose that deacetylated xylan is partially hydrolyzed in the cell walls, liberating xylo-oligosaccharides and their associated lignin oligomers from the cell wall network. Deacetylating xylan thus not only increases its susceptibility to hydrolytic enzymes during saccharification but also changes the cell wall architecture, increasing the extractability of lignin and xylan and facilitating saccharification.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"lignocellulose\": \"Reactant\", \"hardwood xylan\": \"Reactant\", \"acetyl xylan esterase AnAXE1\": \"Catalyst\", \"glucose\": \"Reactant\", \"xylan\": \"Reactant\", \"cellulose\": \"Reactant\", \"lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"dioxane\": \"Solvent\", \"hot water\": \"Solvent\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<acetyl xylan esterase AnAXE1,lignocellulose>\": \"Used in\", \"<acetyl xylan esterase AnAXE1,xylan>\": \"Used in\", \"<glucose,lignocellulose>\": \"Created from\", \"<xylan,lignocellulose>\": \"Created from\", \"<cellulose,lignocellulose>\": \"Created from\", \"<lignin,lignocellulose>\": \"Created from\", \"<dioxane,lignocellulose>\": \"Used in\", \"<hot water,lignocellulose>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

PLA is the product that results from the polymerization of lactide or lactic acid, which is the most extensively produced carboxylic acid in nature by microbial fermentation of carbohydrates . However, the applicability of PLA has been relatively limited because its heat distortion temperature, toughness, and degradation rate are unsatisfactory . One of the methods to resolve these drawbacks is to modify PLA by adding inorganic nanoparticles, including typical nanoclay, carbon nanotubes, zinc oxide, and anatase (A-TiO2) . Recently, the PLA/TiO2 nanocomposites were prepared by us via melting blending PLA with chemically modified TiO2 (solution lactic acid grafted TiO2, hereafter referred to as g-TiO2) . Results showed that TiO2 nanoparticles had a significant effect on the improvement of the mechanical properties of the PLA/TiO2 blends, such as strain at break and elasticity, compared with pure PLA. At the same time, g-TiO2 nanoparticles had a strong influence on hydrolytic degradation and photodegradation of PLA .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Poly (lactic acid)\": \"Reactant\", \"synthetic biodegradable polymer\": \"Organic\", \"lactide\": \"Reactant\", \"lactic acid\": \"Reactant\", \"carboxylic acid\": \"Organic\", \"inorganic nanoparticles\": \"Inorganic\", \"nanoclay\": \"Inorganic\", \"carbon nanotubes\": \"Inorganic\", \"zinc oxide\": \"Inorganic\", \"anatase\": \"Inorganic\", \"PLA/TiO2 nanocomposites\": \"Reactant\", \"TiO2\": \"Inorganic\", \"g-TiO2\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Poly (lactic acid),synthetic biodegradable polymer>\": \"Created from\", \"<lactide,Poly (lactic acid)>\": \"Created from\", \"<lactic acid,Poly (lactic acid)>\": \"Created from\", \"<inorganic nanoparticles,Poly (lactic acid)>\": \"Used in\", \"<PLA/TiO2 nanocomposites,TiO2>\": \"Created from\", \"<PLA/TiO2 nanocomposites,g-TiO2>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

A titanium dioxide (TiO2) coated carrier material is assessed using lab-based photocatalysis experiments, leading to a coating with high photocatalytic activity (deposition speed of 1.4 cm/s for nitrogen monoxide, NO). The coating is tested on several carrier materials to maximize the interaction between the reactive surface and the pollution molecules in the air. Several reactor prototype geometries and carrier materials are simulated and tested on a pilot plant scale. A coated PU-foam with 3 cm thickness and porosity of five pores per inch proved to be the most effective carrier material, while a reactor design with vertically flowed stacks of the foam carrier is capable of optimally exploiting the potential of the photocatalytic coating for high volume flows. With data from on-site measurements of the atmospheric conditions and pollution in the highway tunnel ‘Rudower Höhe’ in Berlin, Germany, we could build a simulated tunnel setup of our reactors within the tunnel. An estimate based on these simulations assumes a reduction potential of 25% of the NOx mass generated in the tunnel. In conclusion, actively vented TiO2 surfaces are controversial yet could achieve high removal rates while simple to clean or exchange.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"active nitric oxides\": \"Reactant\", \"titanium dioxide\": \"Inorganic\", \"photocatalysis\": \"Reaction\", \"nitrogen monoxide\": \"Reactant\", \"reactor prototype geometries\": \"Condition\", \"carrier materials\": \"Reactant\", \"coated PU-foam\": \"Reactant\", \"atmospheric conditions\": \"Condition\", \"pollution\": \"Reactant\", \"highway tunnel ‘Rudower Höhe’ in Berlin, Germany\": \"Condition\", \"simulated tunnel setup\": \"Condition\", \"TiO2 surfaces\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<active nitric oxides,titanium dioxide>\": \"Created from\", \"<nitrogen monoxide,reactor prototype geometries>\": \"Created by\", \"<carrier materials,coated PU-foam>\": \"Used in\", \"<atmospheric conditions,pollution>\": \"Along with\", \"<TiO2 surfaces,simulated tunnel setup>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

This expression pattern for MGAT transcripts agrees with the possibility of MGAT activities in MAG-to-DAG conversion, which was initially hypothesized by Vijayaraj et al. . Beside the acyltransferase activity of MGAT, it was also shown that ArabidopsisMGAT1 acts as a lipase, which could hydrolyze MAG and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as substrates . This may require MGAT enzyme to be actively expressed at an early seed stage (i.e., 14 DAF) to provide the substrates for DGAT1, which, in turn, become abundant at later seed stage (i.e., 21 DAF, see Additional file 1: Fig. S1).

Furthermore, the ilvA gene from Escherichia coli W3110 and the leuDH gene from Thermoactinomyces intermedius were amplified and co-overexpressed. The promoter was altered to regulate the expression strength of ilvA* and leuDH. The final engineered strain E. coli THR ΔrhtAΔilvIH/Gap-ilvA*-Pbs-leuDH was able to produce 9.33 g/L of l-ABA with a yield of 0.19 g/L/h by fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor.ConclusionsThis novel metabolically tailored strain offers a promising approach to fulfill industrial requirements for production of l-ABA.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"l-ABA\": \"Reactant\", \"Escherichia coli\": \"Reactant\", \"metabolic engineering\": \"Condition\", \"fed-batch fermentation\": \"Condition\", \"bioreactor\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<l-ABA,Escherichia coli>\": \"Created from\", \"<l-ABA,metabolic engineering>\": \"Created by\", \"<l-ABA,fed-batch fermentation>\": \"Created by\", \"<l-ABA,bioreactor>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The most obvious reduction in coherence length is observed in ref3-2, a plant with severe lignin deficit . It is possible that the lowered coherence length may be due to curvature of the fibrils. These observations support the necessity of lignin for maintaining proper assembly of cellulose fibrils within cell walls. The loss of integrity of the cellulose fibrils may be an underlying contributor to the extreme dwarfism displayed by this plant. The implication is that lowered lignin content disrupts the natural order of cellulose fibrils within the cell wall. When this happens, it is possible that the cellulose is deposited in the cell wall in such a way that it is susceptible to cell wall enzymes normally involved in wall restructuring. The implication is that cellulose may be produced at normal levels, but with the vast majority of cellulose deposited in an aberrant fashion, most of it is digested and recycled, resulting in a dramatic stunting of plant growth.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"cellulose\": \"Reactant\", \"lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"coherence length\": \"Condition\", \"curvature of the fibrils\": \"Condition\", \"cell wall enzymes\": \"Catalyst\", \"plant growth\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<cellulose,lignin>\": \"Created from\", \"<cellulose,plant growth>\": \"Created by\", \"<lignin,coherence length>\": \"Used in\", \"<cell wall enzymes,cellulose>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Above CMC, in this case, undecanoic acid is mainly present as micelles. Upon the addition of undecanoic acid to the measurement chamber containing the tBLM, the micelles adsorb onto the tBLM surface, partially insert into the lipid bilayer, and affect lipid packing, which thereby lowers the surface tension and increases ionic permeability . As the membrane insertion of undecanoic acid is relatively weak considering its short alkyl chain length and it has low inter-leaflet translocation ability due to its negatively charged headgroup, it is reasonable that undecanoic acid was rinsed away upon the buffer washing step. The disrupted lipid packing was then recovered due to hydrophobic interactions between phospholipid molecules, resulting in recovery of the intact tBLM.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"undecanoic acid\": \"Reactant\", \"phospholipid membranes\": \"Reactant\", \"lipid bilayer\": \"Reactant\", \"buffer washing step\": \"Condition\", \"hydrophobic interactions\": \"Condition\", \"membrane insertion\": \"Reaction\", \"lipid packing\": \"Reaction\", \"ionic permeability\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<undecanoic acid,lipid bilayer>\": \"Created from\", \"<undecanoic acid,buffer washing step>\": \"Created by\", \"<hydrophobic interactions,lipid packing>\": \"Used in\", \"<membrane insertion,ionic permeability>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

The trend in cumulative volume loss observed in Fig. 1 is consistent with previous studies of Al under fixed salt load and constant humidity conditions: after some period of initial corrosion upon humidity exposure22,23, measurable loss effectively ceases. This occurred after similar exposure times (100–500 h) in both this study and in those of refs. 22,23. In-operando XCT data show that this trend is reflective of two primary factors. First, stable pit initiation occurs at a relatively fast rate at the start of humidity exposure. The appearance of new stable pits decreases to a negligible rate after the first 3 days of exposure. Second, all growing pits individually ceased growing, typically within 12–50 h of nucleation. XCT data thus indicate that the trend observed in Fig. 1 is primarily related to the pit-nucleation rate slowing over time.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"corrosion\": \"Reaction\", \"humidity\": \"Condition\", \"Al\": \"Inorganic\", \"pit-nucleation rate\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<corrosion,humidity>\": \"Created by\", \"<corrosion,pit-nucleation rate>\": \"Created by\", \"<Al,humidity>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

The leaf extract of F. wightiana acts as reducing agent which reduces the silver ions into FW-AgNPs, as well as stabilizing agent by capping around them. Biosynthesized FW-AgNPs were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. UV–Vis spectrum showed the characteristic SPR peak between 380 and 460 nm. EDX analysis revealed the presence of metallic silver at 3 keV. XRD analysis clearly revealed that FW-AgNPs are crystalline in nature with FCC structure. TEM analysis depicted the spherical morphology with 20–40 nm in size. DLS analysis showed that average hydrodynamic size and PDI value of FW-AgNPs were found to be 47.6 nm and 4.5 respectively. Biosynthesized FW-AgNPs showed high negative zeta potential value of − 25.3 mV. FTIR analysis revealed the participation of polyphenols and proteins in the bioreduction and stabilization of FW-AgNPs. FW-AgNPs showed strong DPPH and H2O2 scavenging activity with IC50 values of 71.96 and 80.59 µg/mL respectively. Further FW-AgNPs also showed effective cytotoxicity against cancer cells including SKOV3 and COLO205 with maximum inhibition of 83.2% and 75.9% respectively.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"silver nanoparticles\": \"Reactant\", \"leaf extract of Flemingia wightiana\": \"Reactant\", \"reducing agent\": \"Catalyst\", \"silver ions\": \"Reactant\", \"FW-AgNPs\": \"Reactant\", \"UV–Vis spectrum\": \"Condition\", \"EDX analysis\": \"Condition\", \"XRD analysis\": \"Condition\", \"TEM analysis\": \"Condition\", \"DLS analysis\": \"Condition\", \"FTIR analysis\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<silver nanoparticles,leaf extract of Flemingia wightiana>\": \"Created from\", \"<silver ions,reducing agent>\": \"Used in\", \"<FW-AgNPs,UV–Vis spectrum>\": \"Created by\", \"<FW-AgNPs,EDX analysis>\": \"Created by\", \"<FW-AgNPs,XRD analysis>\": \"Created by\", \"<FW-AgNPs,TEM analysis>\": \"Created by\", \"<FW-AgNPs,DLS analysis>\": \"Created by\", \"<FW-AgNPs,FTIR analysis>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Protopanaxadiol (PPD), an active triterpene compound, serves as a precursor of high-value ginsenosides. The introduction of the PHK pathway and multicopy integration of endogenous transaldolase 1 (Tal1) and transketolase 1 (Tkl1) in S. cerevisiae increased the PPD yield to 152.37 mg/L . In addition, the introduction of the PHK pathway in S. cerevisiae increased 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) production by 41.9% and decreased glycerol production by 48.1%. In addition, reducing the expression of phosphoglucose isomerase and overexpressing acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1) and malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) promoted the metabolic flux to the PPP, yielding 864.5 mg/L of 3-HP (24 times the yield of the initial strain) . Furthermore, after being introduced into S. cerevisiae strain containing the ethanol degradation pathway, the Aspergillus nidulans-derived PHK pathway could be used for the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) with a yield of 56.4 mg/g in ethanol medium .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"PHK pathway\": \"Reaction\", \"S. cerevisiae\": \"Reactant\", \"Protopanaxadiol (PPD)\": \"Reactant\", \"endogenous transaldolase 1 (Tal1)\": \"Catalyst\", \"transketolase 1 (Tkl1)\": \"Catalyst\", \"3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP)\": \"Reactant\", \"glycerol\": \"Reactant\", \"phosphoglucose isomerase\": \"Catalyst\", \"acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1)\": \"Catalyst\", \"malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR)\": \"Catalyst\", \"polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Protopanaxadiol (PPD),PHK pathway>\": \"Created from\", \"<endogenous transaldolase 1 (Tal1),PHK pathway>\": \"Used in\", \"<transketolase 1 (Tkl1),PHK pathway>\": \"Used in\", \"<phosphoglucose isomerase,polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)>\": \"Used in\", \"<acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1),polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)>\": \"Used in\", \"<malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR),polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

It is a promising second-generation bioenergy feedstock due, in part, to its hardiness, high yields, low fertilizer requirements', and drought tolerance, and, thus, it has the potential to augment or replace existing starch-based processes for biofuel production . Compared to first-generation biofuels, where added enzymes are used to deconstruct corn starch to dextrose for fermentation to ethanol by yeast, second-generation biofuels target the vast energy reserves stored in plant cell walls. Unlike starch, plant cell walls are generally difficult to deconstruct, since they consist of large, intertwined, recalcitrant biopolymers of C5 sugars (hemicellulose), C6 sugars (cellulose), and lignin . Accessing this reservoir of chemical energy requires the concerted action of multiple enzymes with diverse catalytic activities —a bioengineering feat inherent to various cellulolytic microorganisms capable of solubilizing and ultimately consuming naturally abundant cell wall polysaccharides .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Switchgrass\": \"Reactant\", \"bioenergy\": \"Reactant\", \"starch\": \"Reactant\", \"ethanol\": \"Reactant\", \"yeast\": \"Catalyst\", \"enzymes\": \"Catalyst\", \"plant cell walls\": \"Reactant\", \"biopolymers\": \"Reactant\", \"lignin\": \"Reactant\", \"cellulolytic microorganisms\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<enzymes,starch>\": \"Used in\", \"<enzymes,ethanol>\": \"Used in\", \"<enzymes,plant cell walls>\": \"Used in\", \"<enzymes,lignin>\": \"Used in\", \"<enzymes,biopolymers>\": \"Used in\", \"<cellulolytic microorganisms,plant cell walls>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Conversely, the uncalcined snail shell band was similarly described to have peaks 2θ located at several points coordinating at 26.2, 33.2 and 45.9°, suggesting that snail shell component comprised of CaCO3 . Risso et al.  examined the calcination of waste shells, calcined for the duration of 4 h at 900 °C. The grinded clamshell powder had eventually been transformed into a fine white powder, firmly demonstrating that it was converted into CaO. By comparison, the bands of XRD assessment were discovered at an angle of (2θ) located at several degrees (32.5, 37.6, 54.1 and 62.6°), and this attests to the presence of CaO .

The solution is exact if the nominal composition, equilibrium concentrations and material properties are assumed constant, and can be applied to compounds having no limitations in the number of components. The solution was compared to the solution calculated by a diffusion-controlled application software and it was found that the solute concentrations at the interface can be determined knowing only the nominal composition, the full equilibrium concentrations and the coefficients of diffusion. The thermodynamic calculations owing to find alternative tie-lines are proven to be useless in the mixed-mode model. From this, it appears that the search of alternative tie-lines is computationally counterproductive, even when the interface has a very high mobility. A more efficient computational scheme is possible by considering that a moving interface is not at equilibrium.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Fick's second law\": \"Reaction\", \"nominal composition\": \"Condition\", \"equilibrium concentrations\": \"Condition\", \"material properties\": \"Condition\", \"compounds\": \"Reactant\", \"diffusion-controlled application software\": \"Catalyst\", \"solute concentrations\": \"Reactant\", \"coefficients of diffusion\": \"Condition\", \"thermodynamic calculations\": \"Reaction\", \"alternative tie-lines\": \"Reactant\", \"mixed-mode model\": \"Reaction\", \"interface\": \"Condition\", \"moving interface\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Fick's second law,nominal composition>\": \"Created by\", \"<Fick's second law,equilibrium concentrations>\": \"Created by\", \"<Fick's second law,material properties>\": \"Created by\", \"<compounds,diffusion-controlled application software>\": \"Used in\", \"<solute concentrations,coefficients of diffusion>\": \"Created by\", \"<thermodynamic calculations,alternative tie-lines>\": \"Created from\", \"<mixed-mode model,interface>\": \"Along with\", \"<mixed-mode model,moving interface>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Cu2O/BSA NPS had size of 20–50 nm and were composed of several 6–7 nm Cu2O nanocrystals and BSA. BSA acted as the structure-directing agent, guiding the formation of Cu2O/BSA NCPs. N-terminal peptides, histidine and tryptophan residues of BSA coordinated with Cu2+ and then controlled the nucleation, growth and assembly of Cu(OH)2 at binding sites to form the hierarchical structure. After the reduction reaction, Cu2O/BSA NCPs were obtained. The Cu2O/BSA hierarchical structure exhibited excellent antibacterial performance due to the oriented release of copper ions. The good biocompatibility of BSA was beneficial to the contact with cell walls and site-specific release of Cu+.

The performances of epoxy-cured thermosetting nanocomposites are reported for the first time. The partially exfoliated structure of clay layers was confirmed by XRD and TEM. FTIR spectra indicate the presence of H bonding between nanoclay and the polymer matrix. The present investigation outlines the significant improvement of tensile strength, scratch hardness, thermostability, water vapor permeability, and adhesive strength without much influencing impact resistance, bending, and elongation at break of the nanocomposites compared to pristine HBPU thermoset. An increment of two times the tensile strength, 6 °C of melting point, and 111 °C of thermo-stability were achieved by the formation of nanocomposites. An excellent shape recovery of about 96–99% was observed for the nanocomposites. Thus, the formation of partially exfoliated clay/vegetable oil-based hyperbranched polyurethane nanocomposites significantly improved the performance.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"polyurethanes\": \"Organic\", \"vegetable oil-based polymer nanocomposites\": \"Organic\", \"Mesua ferrea L. seed oil-based hyperbranched polyurethane\": \"Organic\", \"clay nanocomposites\": \"Inorganic\", \"epoxy-cured thermosetting nanocomposites\": \"Organic\", \"nanoclay\": \"Inorganic\", \"polymer matrix\": \"Organic\", \"nanocomposites\": \"Organic\", \"HBPU thermoset\": \"Organic\", \"partially exfoliated clay/vegetable oil-based hyperbranched polyurethane nanocomposites\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<polyurethanes,vegetable oil-based polymer nanocomposites>\": \"Created from\", \"<Mesua ferrea L. seed oil-based hyperbranched polyurethane,clay nanocomposites>\": \"Created from\", \"<epoxy-cured thermosetting nanocomposites,nanoclay>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoclay,polymer matrix>\": \"Used in\", \"<nanocomposites,HBPU thermoset>\": \"Created from\", \"<partially exfoliated clay/vegetable oil-based hyperbranched polyurethane nanocomposites,nanocomposites>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The porous structure could act as an electrode directly, free of binder and conductive agent, which promotes an improved electron transfer, and provides a 3D network for an enhanced ion transport, thus leading to an increased capacity and stable long cycle stability performance. Notably, the specific capacity of MoS2/reduced graphene aerogel is 1041 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1. Moreover, reversible capacities of 667 mA h g−1 with 58.6% capacity retention are kept after 100 cycles. The outstanding performance is beneficial from the synergistic effect of the MoS2 nanostructure and graphene conductive network, as well as the binder-free design. These results provide a route to integrate transition-metal-dichalcogenides with graphene to fabricate composites with rich micro-pores and a three-dimensional network for energy storage devices.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"MoS2/reduced graphene aerogels\": \"Reactant\", \"hydrothermal method\": \"Reaction\", \"freeze-drying\": \"Condition\", \"annealing treatment\": \"Condition\", \"electron transfer\": \"Reaction\", \"ion transport\": \"Reaction\", \"capacity\": \"Condition\", \"cycle stability performance\": \"Condition\", \"MoS2 nanostructure\": \"Inorganic\", \"graphene conductive network\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<MoS2/reduced graphene aerogels,hydrothermal method>\": \"Created from\", \"<MoS2/reduced graphene aerogels,freeze-drying>\": \"Created by\", \"<MoS2/reduced graphene aerogels,annealing treatment>\": \"Created by\", \"<electron transfer,ion transport>\": \"Along with\", \"<MoS2 nanostructure,graphene conductive network>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

This is what we call herein a similar-size representation. For example, for a small molecule like anisole that is composed of 16 atoms, a 3 Å × 3 Å PD was generated. The equivalent PD of a medium-size molecule such as the tert-butylcalixarene (105 atoms) is of comparable size (4 Å × 4 Å). Similarly, the PD of a large structure, the main protease of the new coronavirus identified as COVID-1964 in complex with an inhibitor N3 (2500 non-hydrogen atoms) has size of 6 Å × 6 Å. A detailed analysis is given in Supplementary Note 2.

In order to develop an understanding of the drivers of STP use and product acceptability we conducted both human sensory panel testing and chemical analyses on a range of STPs. Free-sorting paired odour testing using sensory panellists identified similarities and clear differences between eleven different STPs. Headspace volatiles, analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS), identified 20 to 70 components depending upon the STP. Key differences in headspace volatiles were found between STPs. For example, the headspace of Skoal Bandits Wintergreen was dominated by methyl salicylate, while Marlboro Spice consists of a more complex profile including pinene, nicotine, eugenol and cymene. Chemometric Target Factor Analysis (TFA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) of chemistry and sensory data was used to deduce chemical drivers of sensory perceptions. The chemometric strategy used showed that headspace analysis is a complementary screening tool to sensory analysis in classification studies. This study is generic with applications across various product sectors that require routine human sensory panel evaluation.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Smokeless tobacco products\": \"Reactant\", \"chemosensory characteristics\": \"Condition\", \"human sensory panel testing\": \"Condition\", \"chemical analyses\": \"Condition\", \"headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry\": \"Condition\", \"methyl salicylate\": \"Organic\", \"pinene\": \"Organic\", \"nicotine\": \"Organic\", \"eugenol\": \"Organic\", \"cymene\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Smokeless tobacco products,chemosensory characteristics>\": \"Created by\", \"<methyl salicylate,Skoal Bandits Wintergreen>\": \"Created from\", \"<pinene,Marlboro Spice>\": \"Created from\", \"<nicotine,Marlboro Spice>\": \"Created from\", \"<eugenol,Marlboro Spice>\": \"Created from\", \"<cymene,Marlboro Spice>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

To test this further, we carried out additional experiments crushing not only granite (a common rock in the continental crust since the Precambrian) but also basalt and peridotite (representing oceanic crust).

Multiple principal element alloys generally, and high-entropy alloys specifically, have been cited as possible sets of materials for these extreme environments due to large design space and radiation resistance. However, based on the results here, the microstructural stability of HEAs under multiple extremes clearly depends strongly on the specific environmental exposure during irradiation and on the alloy composition. The CoCrCuFeNi film grown on a layer of SiO2 remained relatively stable under room temperature ion irradiation up to peak dose of about 500 dpa, while the same film grown on Si began losing stability at the interface with Si at a low dose of about 1 dpa, large-scale phase change started at doses over 6 dpa, and exceptionally large grain size increase by a dose of ~170 dpa. Now that the vast differences between radiation response is clear, it is important to understand the mechanisms for the dramatic changes under room temperature ion irradiation.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"materials\": \"Reactant\", \"radiation\": \"Condition\", \"environmental conditions\": \"Condition\", \"microstructural stability\": \"Condition\", \"HEAs\": \"Reactant\", \"CoCrCuFeNi film\": \"Reactant\", \"SiO2\": \"Inorganic\", \"room temperature ion irradiation\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<CoCrCuFeNi film,SiO2>\": \"Created from\", \"<CoCrCuFeNi film,room temperature ion irradiation>\": \"Used in\", \"<HEAs,radiation>\": \"Used in\", \"<HEAs,environmental conditions>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

As shown in Fig. 2, IrO3(g) has the highest partial pressure by at least three orders of magnitude of the species, except Oxygen, throughout the range of temperatures considered. At our growth temperature of 1163 K, the partial pressure of IrO3(g) is 2 × 10−3 Torr. With O2(g) in the growth chamber, regardless of the Ir flux type (Ir metal vapor or Ir-O binary compounds, or Ir precursor) provided from the source materials, the dominant Ir flux to the substrate surface is gaseous IrO3(g). The partial pressure of IrO3(g) depends on the equilibrium of species in gas phase such as O2(g) and Ir(g), and is not an independent thermodynamic variable nor an independent experimental growth parameter. This high vapor pressure of IrO3(g) explains the common Ir deficiency of thin films24.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"solid and vapor phases\": \"Condition\", \"substrate temperature\": \"Condition\", \"partial pressure vs. temperature relationship\": \"Reaction\", \"binary Ir-O and Pr-O systems\": \"Reaction\", \"IrO3(g)\": \"Reactant\", \"Oxygen\": \"Inorganic\", \"growth temperature\": \"Condition\", \"Ir flux\": \"Reactant\", \"source materials\": \"Reactant\", \"equilibrium of species in gas phase\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<IrO3(g),Oxygen>\": \"Created from\", \"<IrO3(g),growth temperature>\": \"Created by\", \"<Ir flux,source materials>\": \"Created from\", \"<equilibrium of species in gas phase,IrO3(g)>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

These results were unforeseen, as the level of butanol generated by these strains is significantly lower than the level added exogenously during the tolerance studies . In addition, the level of ethanol production was slightly reduced at early time points in the butanol resistant strain (Fig. 5c). This is suggestive that in the butanol resistant strain, a higher flux is attained towards butanol and away from ethanol than in the butanol sensitive strain. These results provide proof of principle that strains that are more resistant to the effects of butanol (and other fusel alcohols) have improved yields of these alcohols from production pathways.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"alcohol\": \"Reactant\", \"butanol\": \"Reactant\", \"ethanol\": \"Reactant\", \"tolerance studies\": \"Condition\", \"production pathways\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<alcohol,butanol>\": \"Created from\", \"<butanol,tolerance studies>\": \"Used in\", \"<ethanol,production pathways>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Wang et al.  assessed the effect of eugenol (100 μg/mL) in the mycelia of B. cinerea using the fluorescent Ca+2 indicator Fluo3-AM. The final concentration of Fluo3-AM was adjusted to 5 µmol/L and prepared from a 5 mmol/L dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stock solution. The buffer used was 10 mmol/L 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES, pH 7.4), and the samples were observed with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Following treatment, the concentration of Ca2+ increased and had reached the highest level at 30 min, suggesting that eugenol either directly or indirectly changed the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and was related to the biological effects. This Ca2+ increment in the cytosol was potentially due to the Ca2+ released from internal stores (such as the vacuoles or the endoplasmic reticulum) .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"eugenol\": \"Reactant\", \"Ca2+\": \"Reactant\", \"Fluo3-AM\": \"Reactant\", \"DMSO\": \"Solvent\", \"HEPES\": \"Solvent\", \"cytosolic Ca2+\": \"Reactant\", \"vacuoles\": \"Inorganic\", \"endoplasmic reticulum\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<eugenol,Ca2+>\": \"Created from\", \"<Fluo3-AM,DMSO>\": \"Created from\", \"<cytosolic Ca2+,vacuoles>\": \"Created by\", \"<cytosolic Ca2+,endoplasmic reticulum>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Our results show that all typical DUIs tested in combination with cocaine did not affect its ability to block DA reuptake, as shown by additive effects on DA clearance rate. Typical DUIs like WIN 35428 and methylphenidate produced additive effects also on cocaine-induced enhancement of evoked DAMax. In contrast, an opposite effect was observed for JJC8-091 and JHW 007, which blunted cocaine-induced enhancement of evoked DAMax. The mechanism behind this effect may relate to the conformation DAT assumes when interacting with an atypical DUI. The inward-occluded DAT conformation in addition to the slow DAT dissociation rate obtained with atypical DUIs may prevent DAT from binding to cocaine, thus preventing DAT conformational changes that lead to the enhancement effects of cocaine on evoked DA release.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"cocaine\": \"Reactant\", \"DA\": \"Reactant\", \"DUIs\": \"Reactant\", \"WIN 35428\": \"Reactant\", \"methylphenidate\": \"Reactant\", \"JJC8-091\": \"Reactant\", \"JHW 007\": \"Reactant\", \"atypical DUI\": \"Reactant\", \"DAT\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<cocaine,DA>\": \"Created from\", \"<cocaine,DAT>\": \"Used in\", \"<atypical DUI,DAT>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Numerous efforts have been devoted to the regulation of Ti3C2Tx MXene, however, tuning interlayer spacing and surface halogen termination of other MXenes (besides Ti3C2Tx) is rarely reported while demanded. Here we propose a Lewis-basic halides treatment, which is capable of simultaneously engineering the interlayer spacing and surface termination of various MXenes. Benefited from the abundant desolvated halogen anions and cations in molten state Lewis-basic halides, the -F termination was substituted by nucleophilic reaction and the interlayer spacing was enlarged. Ti3C2Tx MXene treated by this method showed a high specific capacity of 229 mAh g−1 for Li+ storage, which is almost 2 times higher than pristine one. Considering the universality, our method provides an approach to regulating the properties of MXenes, which may expand their potential applications in energy storage, optoelectronics and beyond.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Ti3C2Tx MXene\": \"Reactant\", \"Lewis-basic halides\": \"Catalyst\", \"interlayer spacing\": \"Condition\", \"surface termination\": \"Condition\", \"desolvated halogen anions and cations\": \"Reactant\", \"molten state Lewis-basic halides\": \"Solvent\", \"-F termination\": \"Reactant\", \"nucleophilic reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"Li+ storage\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Ti3C2Tx MXene,Lewis-basic halides>\": \"Used in\", \"<Lewis-basic halides,interlayer spacing>\": \"Created by\", \"<Lewis-basic halides,surface termination>\": \"Created by\", \"<desolvated halogen anions and cations,molten state Lewis-basic halides>\": \"Created from\", \"<-F termination,nucleophilic reaction>\": \"Created from\", \"<nucleophilic reaction,Li+ storage>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The enhanced performances of Cu/CuI/ZnO core/double-shell microwire photodetector resulted from the formation of heterojunction. Benefiting from the piezo-phototronic effect, the presentation of piezocharges can lower the barrier height and facilitate the charge transport across heterojunction. The photosensing abilities of the Cu/CuI/ZnO core/double-shell microwire detector are investigated under different UV light densities and strain conditions. We demonstrate the I-V characteristic of the as-prepared core/double-shell device; it is quite sensitive to applied strain, which indicates that the piezo-phototronic effect plays an essential role in facilitating charge carrier transport across the CuI/ZnO heterojunction, then the performance of the device is further boosted under external strain.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"CuI/ZnO double-shell nanostructure\": \"Reactant\", \"UV photodetector\": \"Reactant\", \"copper microwire\": \"Reactant\", \"heterojunction\": \"Reaction\", \"piezo-phototronic effect\": \"Condition\", \"charge transport\": \"Reaction\", \"strain conditions\": \"Condition\", \"I-V characteristic\": \"Condition\", \"external strain\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<CuI/ZnO double-shell nanostructure,UV photodetector>\": \"Created from\", \"<piezo-phototronic effect,heterojunction>\": \"Used in\", \"<strain conditions,I-V characteristic>\": \"Along with\", \"<external strain,heterojunction>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

The engineered strain produced 4.10 g/L of PCN with a yield of 0.23 (g/g) from glycerol, which was the highest PCN titer and the yield ever obtained so far among PCN-producing strains. The integrated analysis of gene expression, metabolomics, and dynamic 13C tracer enabled us to gain a more in-depth insight into complex mechanisms for the PCN overproduction. Rerouting of central carbon to the shikimate pathway and metabolite channeling facilitated the PCN production. This study demonstrated that integrating systems biology analysis could be an efficient way to identify metabolic responses to the PCN overproduction, forming the basis for the rational design and engineering of the high efficiency strains using glycerol as the cost-effective carbon source. This approach would have a great potential for the future industrial production and agricultural application of biopesticide phenazines.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"PCN\": \"Reactant\", \"P. chlororaphis HT66\": \"Reactant\", \"glycerol\": \"Reactant\", \"gene expression\": \"Condition\", \"metabolomics\": \"Condition\", \"dynamic 13C tracer\": \"Condition\", \"shikimate pathway\": \"Reaction\", \"metabolite channeling\": \"Reaction\", \"systems biology analysis\": \"Condition\", \"high efficiency strains\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<PCN,P. chlororaphis HT66>\": \"Created from\", \"<PCN,glycerol>\": \"Created from\", \"<shikimate pathway,metabolite channeling>\": \"Used in\", \"<high efficiency strains,systems biology analysis>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

A similar observation was seen from the XRD in Supplementary Fig. 2, the most intense Bragg reflection (1 0 4) Miller planes for Ca0.51Fe0.49CO3 showed a decrease in intensity. It is interesting to note that there is no significant difference in the intensity for FeCO3-covering sample, and the measured semi-circle of the FeCO3-covering sample was larger than that of Ca0.51Fe0.49CO3-covering samples, suggesting that the crystalline FeCO3 dissolved slower than Ca0.51Fe0.49CO3.

The reaction process involves multiple reaction steps. The multiplicity of the process is described by electrons captured or released by electrolytic ions at the surface of electrodes, resulting in a multiphasic gas–liquid–solid transition occurring within the overall process. During the multiphasic switch, water is continually split into hydrogen and oxygen (O2) through two crucial multi-proton/electron combined half-cell reactions, which are the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, in the quest to achieve an efficient water oxidation/splitting process, a clear and thorough understanding of both HER and OER mechanisms in different pH environment is crucial. This is also an important part considered in designing efficient and effective electrocatalysts. Also, it is undoubtedly an important factor that determines the acceptance of future large-scale application of the technology to satisfy the global renewable and clean energy demand, including free environment from pollution liabilities caused by the conventional hydrocarbon energy sources.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"electrolytic reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"hydrogen\": \"Reactant\", \"electrochemical reactions\": \"Reaction\", \"electrodes\": \"Condition\", \"water\": \"Reactant\", \"hydrogen evolution reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"oxygen evolution reaction\": \"Reaction\", \"pH environment\": \"Condition\", \"electrocatalysts\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<hydrogen,electrolytic reaction>\": \"Created from\", \"<water,hydrogen evolution reaction>\": \"Created from\", \"<pH environment,hydrogen evolution reaction>\": \"Along with\", \"<electrocatalysts,hydrogen evolution reaction>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

The additives, which include asparaginase as well as amino acids and compounds with thiol groups, are added to the STP formulation prior to heat processing and have been shown to significantly reduce acrylamide concentrations. Asparaginase, for example, which converts asparagine to aspartic acid, was reported to reduce the acrylamide level in the processed STP by 67 %, when added to the formulation at 250 ppm. The patent also shows that lowering the pH of the formulation from 8.7 to 6.5 by removing sodium hydroxide, was reported to cause a 93 % reduction in the acrylamide level.

The growth patterns of dZA1 and dZA2 were almost identical to those of the parental zep line and wild type (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the edited lesions of the AGP gene in dZAs does not have any detrimental effect on the growth of dZAs and increases the oil content. To validate the higher TAG accumulation in the dZAs, oil droplets in the cells were visualized through microscopic fluorescence analysis and compared with the parental strains (Fig. 1D). Further, for the quantification of triacylglycerol (TAG), we measured the Nile red fluorescence of each cell line growing under nitrogen starvation conditions and normalized this to the same cell numbers. The two dZA strains displayed more than two-fold higher Nile red fluorescence than the parental strains (Fig. 1E). These results showed that the dZAs exhibited increased TAG synthesis through metabolite changes when AGP was knocked out.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"dZAs\": \"Reactant\", \"AGP\": \"Reactant\", \"growth\": \"Reaction\", \"oil content\": \"Reactant\", \"TAG\": \"Reactant\", \"nitrogen starvation conditions\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<dZAs,growth>\": \"Used in\", \"<AGP,oil content>\": \"Created from\", \"<TAG,nitrogen starvation conditions>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The Fh8 fusion tag acts as an effective solubility enhancer that aims to improve the expression of six eukaryotic proteins from different organisms that include Artocarpus incisa, Cryptosporidium parvum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, high soluble expression of these proteins was achieved with the aid of the Fh8 tag . Although commonly used fusion tags are effective in large part by solving inclusion bodies and improving expression levels, there is currently no guarantee of success. Determining the correct fusion partners to optimize heterologous protein expression is not empirical but largely depends on the passenger protein. Fusion partners are protein specific and not a universal method for solubilizing passenger proteins . Current fusion expression partners still need to be improved with the aim of properly expressing various heterologous proteins. Thus, the development of novel fusion tags that permit effective expression and enhanced solubility of heterologous proteins is an urgent need.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Heparinase I\": \"Reactant\", \"Fh8 fusion tag\": \"Catalyst\", \"Artocarpus incisa\": \"Organic\", \"Cryptosporidium parvum\": \"Organic\", \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Heparinase I,Fh8 fusion tag>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

All the alloys exhibited a limiting current plateau region in their voltage–current behaviour, but not all gave a wide and smooth plateau, except one with almost pure Ni. With the alloys of including more than 50% Ni, as Ni ratio of the metal increased, smoother and wider plateau was attained, and the electrode containing 99% Ni gave the smoothest plateau. The other alloys tested can only be used as electrode in the limiting diffusion current technique in low flow velocities in which the transfer of the active ion to the electrode surface is as slow as that the mass transfer controls the rate of system.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ferricyanide\": \"Reactant\", \"Ni\": \"Inorganic\", \"electrode\": \"Reactant\", \"limiting diffusion current technique\": \"Reaction\", \"cathodic reduction\": \"Reaction\", \"voltage–current behaviour\": \"Condition\", \"metal\": \"Inorganic\", \"active ion\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ferricyanide,cathodic reduction>\": \"Used in\", \"<Ni,electrode>\": \"Created from\", \"<active ion,electrode>\": \"Created from\", \"<limiting diffusion current technique,voltage–current behaviour>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

Although our model indicated no overarching influence of temperature on global Gnet rates, individual reefs had greater Gnet with higher water temperatures and in warmer seasons20,71 (Figs. 2, 3). Similarly, when all previous site-specific models that use physicochemical parameters to predict Gnet were compiled, the only model to significantly correlate with global Gnet observations relied on temperature alone42,67. In general, increasing temperatures increase coral growth until a thermal threshold is reached29. The magnitude of this effect can be dependent on species, location or latitude56,91. High-latitude reefs may initially benefit from increasing ocean temperatures with some having rising calcification rates4,91, supporting our observation of increasing Gnet with warming on seasonal time scales (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the benefit of increased Gnet on reefs from rising temperatures will be negated when bleaching events occur, which can decrease ecosystem calcification >100%16–18 due to coral mortality and sub-lethal stress59. Declining calcification on lower-latitude reefs is likely due to rising temperatures rather than ocean acidification91, indicating that ocean warming will have latitude- and magnitude-specific impacts on coral reefs.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"Gnet\": \"Reactant\", \"water temperatures\": \"Condition\", \"warmer seasons\": \"Condition\", \"coral growth\": \"Reaction\", \"thermal threshold\": \"Condition\", \"ocean temperatures\": \"Condition\", \"bleaching events\": \"Reaction\", \"ocean acidification\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<temperature,Gnet>\": \"Created by\", \"<water temperatures,Gnet>\": \"Created by\", \"<warmer seasons,Gnet>\": \"Created by\", \"<thermal threshold,coral growth>\": \"Created by\", \"<ocean temperatures,coral growth>\": \"Created by\", \"<bleaching events,coral growth>\": \"Created by\", \"<ocean acidification,coral growth>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

In Fig. 9 we see that the contributions for the two oxygen atoms are different: positive for the first oxygen token in the string, and negative for the second. All the three methods (B, C, D) attributed the opposite direction to both oxygen atoms. As of additional information, all atoms have positive contribution in the FPA contributions, which also disagrees with the three methods. To ignore the magnitude in this example, we set the color domain to be equal to a tiny value, i.e., between − 0.00001 and 0.00001.

In the present work, two-dimensional compositional gradient in multi-component gas and oil mixtures is modeled. A thermodynamic model is developed based on molecular diffusion coefficients in mass diffusive flux. A combination of Sigmund and Bird correlations is considered to estimate molecular diffusion coefficients for gas mixtures. Implementing this comprehensive developed model on a gas condensate sample shows interesting differences not only in trends of component compositions but also in gradient magnitude. A real set of data from a supergiant gas condensate field is used to validate the model. It is perceived that the developed model reduces relative absolute errors to about 50%. In the next step, a comprehensive study was conducted to understand the cross effects of molecular diffusion and natural convection in gas condensate and volatile oil samples. Gas and oil samples are selected to investigate if natural convection has the same effects in different samples. It is observed that increase in natural convection causes to reduce horizontal and vertical composition gradients. This effect is more significant in gas reservoir, as methane composition varies by more than 5.2 mol% diagonally in gas condensate sample, whereas this value is about 0.45 mol% in volatile oil sample. Lower density and higher bulk velocity in gas sample cause more disturbances in flow streams of gas mixture. Evaluation of the developed model shows that the model is reliable for reservoir studies and management programs.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"hydrocarbon reservoir\": \"Reactant\", \"molecular diffusion coefficients\": \"Condition\", \"gas condensate sample\": \"Reactant\", \"supergiant gas condensate field\": \"Reactant\", \"natural convection\": \"Condition\", \"methane composition\": \"Reactant\", \"volatile oil sample\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<molecular diffusion coefficients,gas condensate sample>\": \"Used in\", \"<natural convection,methane composition>\": \"Created by\", \"<natural convection,volatile oil sample>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

In addition, to further improve BGA in T. reesei, gene (aabgl1) encoding β-glucosidase 1 in Aspergillus aculeatus was overexpressed in T. reesei Rut C30 under the constitutive pyruvate decarboxylase promoter pdc1. The recombinant strain was used for cellulase production by fed-batch fermentation through feeding the soluble inducer. Furthermore, cellulosic ethanol production was performed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae through separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) using the crude cellulases. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that high titers of both cellulases and β-glucosidase have been achieved by the fed-batch fermentation.

Vitis vinifera AOMT (VvAOMT1) and fragrant cyclamen ‘Kaori-no-mai’ AOMT (CkmOMT2) were found to be the most effective AOMTs for production of the 3′-O-methylated product peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G), attaining the highest titers at 2.4 and 2.7 mg/L, respectively. Following modulation of plasmid copy number and optimization of VvAOMT1 and CkmOMT2 expression conditions, production was further improved to 23 mg/L using VvAOMT1. Finally, CRISPRi was utilized to silence the transcriptional repressor MetJ in order to deregulate the methionine biosynthetic pathway and improve SAM availability for O-methylation of cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (C3G), the biosynthetic precursor to P3G. MetJ repression led to a final titer of 51 mg/L (56 mg/L upon scale-up to shake flask), representing a twofold improvement over the non-targeting CRISPRi control strain and 21-fold improvement overall.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT)\": \"Catalyst\", \"Escherichia coli\": \"Reactant\", \"Petunia hybrida anthocyanidin synthase (PhANS)\": \"Catalyst\", \"Arabidopsis thaliana anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (At3GT)\": \"Catalyst\", \"Vitis vinifera AOMT (VvAOMT1)\": \"Catalyst\", \"fragrant cyclamen ‘Kaori-no-mai’ AOMT (CkmOMT2)\": \"Catalyst\", \"peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G)\": \"Reactant\", \"MetJ\": \"Catalyst\", \"cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (C3G)\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT),peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G)>\": \"Created from\", \"<MetJ,cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (C3G)>\": \"Created from\", \"<Vitis vinifera AOMT (VvAOMT1),peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G)>\": \"Created from\", \"<fragrant cyclamen ‘Kaori-no-mai’ AOMT (CkmOMT2),peonidin 3-O-glucoside (P3G)>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

We showed previously that heterologous expression of alkL in E. coli could improve dodecane (C12) oxidation by up to 2 orders of magnitude . The uptake process was evaluated by using the P. putida alkane monooxygenase (AlkB). This inner membrane complex receives electrons from NADH, via rubredoxin reductase (AlkT) and rubredoxin (AlkG), and transfers one oxygen to the alkane substrate while the other is reduced to H2O . Ultimately, it oxidizes alkanes to fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes, and fatty acids and has been investigated industrially for the bioconversion of octane to octanol .

For studying the function of the gene, a recombinant GjCyp-1 containing a CaMV35S promoter at the amino-terminus was constructed and expressed in Nicotiana tabacum. Tobacco seedlings confirmed as transgenic sense plant were heat shocked for 2 h at 45°C and then its chlorophyll contents were compared with the tobacco seedlings carrying only the vector under the same heat shock. The results strongly supported the protective effect of red algal Cyp against heat stress. To investigate the subcellular localization of GjCyp-1, GjCyp-1 was translationally fused in-frame to the N-terminus of soluble-modified green fluorescent protein (smGFP). In analysis of confocal microscopy using particle gun bombardment, the smGFP-fusion protein was confirmed in the cytosol of onion epidermal cells. Here, it was suggested that GjCyp-1 was a algal CypA lineage localizing in cytosol and induced thermoprotective activity.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Cyclophilin\": \"Reactant\", \"GjCyp-1\": \"Reactant\", \"CaMV35S promoter\": \"Reactant\", \"Nicotiana tabacum\": \"Reactant\", \"heat shock\": \"Condition\", \"chlorophyll\": \"Reactant\", \"red algal Cyp\": \"Reactant\", \"GjCyp-1\": \"Reactant\", \"soluble-modified green fluorescent protein\": \"Reactant\", \"onion epidermal cells\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<GjCyp-1,CaMV35S promoter>\": \"Created from\", \"<GjCyp-1,soluble-modified green fluorescent protein>\": \"Created from\", \"<GjCyp-1,heat shock>\": \"Used in\", \"<GjCyp-1,Nicotiana tabacum>\": \"Used in\", \"<GjCyp-1,onion epidermal cells>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

The measured mass was m/z 283.0579 with a 2.7 mDa error off the theoretical mass 283.0606. Characteristic product ions at m/z 265.0457 −, 240.0377 −, 237.0520 −, 196.0456 −, 173.0529 − and 109.0207 − were formed and consistently in the extracts of reddish pigments and sappanwood as well as standard brazilein (Fig. 8g–i). The fragmentation mechanism was shown in Additional file 3c according to the work by Hulme et al. . Brazilin could be transformed into brazilein by oxidation but remained detectable due to two reasons: the oxidation reaction was inhibited in slightly acidic environment to some extent, or certain precursors could be convert into brazilin by heating or catalytic amounts of acid or base . Therefore, dye precursor brazilin and the oxidized brazilein were both detected in the reddish pigment extract.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"Brazilein\": \"Reactant\", \"brazilin\": \"Reactant\", \"oxidation\": \"Reaction\", \"acid\": \"Catalyst\", \"base\": \"Catalyst\", \"heating\": \"Condition\", \"slightly acidic environment\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Brazilein,brazilin>\": \"Created from\", \"<brazilin,Brazilein>\": \"Created from\", \"<oxidation,Brazilein>\": \"Created from\", \"<heating,brazilin>\": \"Along with\", \"<slightly acidic environment,brazilin>\": \"Along with\", \"<acid,brazilin>\": \"Used in\", \"<base,brazilin>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Real-space HAADF–STEM analysis of ultrathin polymer sections provides a detailed assessment of the nano-morphology of the mixtures. The well-known advantage of the HAADF–STEM imaging technique is its sensitivity towards the variation of the scattering density in the sample. The intensity on HAADF–STEM images scales approximately proportional to the square of the atomic number.40, 41 However, poor contrast between the phase-separated blocks impedes imaging of the microstructure without staining. Therefore, osmium tetroxide OsO4 was used as a selective staining agent for the charged PDMAEA–PCEA phase to enhance contrast before HAADF–STEM imaging (Figure 6). Uranylacetate staining was also applied and provided the same morphological information with the charged PDMAEA–PCEA phase seen as bright domains in the acquired images (Supplementary Figure S26).Figure 6Rheometry measurements of individual triblock copolymers and the resulting mixtures.

While the templating capability of the amyloid structure is well documented, it remains to be shown how far their self-organizing nature can be taken towards a self-replicating system of simpler molecules in more prebiotic conditions. With this in mind we designed peptides with binary alternating sequences of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino-acid residues, a pattern known to favor amphipathic β–strands that aggregate into cross-β fibers22–24. The individual template and substrate peptides were designed to be soluble at neutral pH due to charge repulsion, yet able to form an amyloid when mixed. We have investigated four different template/substrate pairs and in all cases observed a significant enhancement of sequence-selective and stereoselective amino-acid addition. Furthermore, in a substrate peptide that involved both side-chain and N-terminal reactive sites, we also observed a regioselectivity for N-terminal additions in the substrate/template amyloid that was absent in the soluble substrate.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"molecular replication\": \"Reaction\", \"amyloid structure\": \"Reactant\", \"peptides\": \"Reactant\", \"hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino-acid residues\": \"Organic\", \"neutral pH\": \"Condition\", \"sequence-selective and stereoselective amino-acid addition\": \"Reaction\", \"side-chain and N-terminal reactive sites\": \"Reactant\", \"N-terminal additions\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<peptides,molecular replication>\": \"Used in\", \"<neutral pH,peptides>\": \"Created by\", \"<side-chain and N-terminal reactive sites,N-terminal additions>\": \"Created from\", \"<hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino-acid residues,peptides>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The effects of gamma radiation were scarcely observed in coefficient of friction. The coefficient of friction under lubricated (distilled water) and non-lubricated testing conditions was 0.08 to 0.12 and 0.20 to 0.25, respectively. The wear volume of UHMWPE with radiation of 50 Mrad, 75 to 150 Mrad, and 200 Mrad was 70 to 80%, 18 to 25%, and 12 to 15%, respectively, in comparison to non-irradiated specimens. Elongation and tensile strength of UHMWPE with radiation of 100 Mrad decreased to 6%, and 50% of that without radiation, respectively. The hardness increased with increase of the radiation dose. From several kinds of tribological findings, mechanical strength tests, and studies of long-term clinical findings, it is concluded that approximately 200 Mrad is the optimum dose of gamma radiation for clinical use in total hip prostheses.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"UHMWPE\": \"Reactant\", \"gamma radiation\": \"Condition\", \"alumina ball\": \"Reactant\", \"distilled water\": \"Solvent\", \"coefficient of friction\": \"Condition\", \"wear volume\": \"Condition\", \"tribology testing machine\": \"Condition\", \"total hip prostheses\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<UHMWPE,gamma radiation>\": \"Created by\", \"<UHMWPE,total hip prostheses>\": \"Used in\", \"<alumina ball,UHMWPE>\": \"Created from\", \"<distilled water,coefficient of friction>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

For the 12 RRAM selector candidates, the margins of Si0.4S0.3Te0.3 (#5) and N0.1S0.6Sn0.3 (#12) raise slightly to 8.6% and 6.3%, respectively. The other 10 alloys have a 10.0% (or more) and are promising. Out of these, 4 materials (#1, 6, 10, and 11) contain a combination of P and S.

The improvement in fermentation performance was evidenced by the higher ethanol titers and lower marginal xylitol excretion compared with the unadapted reference.

HEPES-buffered cultures showed the highest OD750, while the HCl-titrated cultures showed the highest isobutanol production (Fig. 1b). The dramatic differences between the cultures with and without pH adjustment may indicate that, in the sealed cultivation system applied, pH plays an important role to affect carbon supply. When the pH was above 10, most of the carbon existed in the form of CO32− in the media, which cannot be up taken by the cells. When the pH in the culture was adjusted, the carbon equilibrium shifted forward to generate relatively more HCO3− and CO2. At this stage, the cells can assimilate more carbon, resulting in enhanced growth and isobutanol production. However, the HEPES-buffered cultures grew to a higher OD750 than the HCl-titrated culture, though the pH in the later cultures was closer to the theoretical optimal pH for Synechocystis  (Fig. 1b). This may be due to HEPES being much milder than HCl and better for maintaining enzyme structure and cell physiological characters .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"pH\": \"Condition\", \"isobutanol\": \"Reactant\", \"HEPES\": \"Catalyst\", \"HCl\": \"Catalyst\", \"carbon\": \"Inorganic\", \"Synechocystis\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<isobutanol,pH>\": \"Created by\", \"<isobutanol,HEPES>\": \"Created by\", \"<isobutanol,HCl>\": \"Created by\", \"<carbon,pH>\": \"Created from\", \"<Synechocystis,pH>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

The patterns for the CSs and PCSs-0.075 contain two broad diffraction peaks, at 2θ values around 22.3° and 43.6°, which are indexed to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon and the (100) diffraction of amorphous graphitic carbon. The peaks are broad and weak, which indicates a low degree of graphitization; this agrees well with the HRTEM results. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the amorphous degree of the CSs and PCSs from the ratio of the D-band and G-band intensities (ID/IG). Figure 5d clearly shows that the spectra of the CSs and PCSs-0.075 contain two clear peaks, at 1328 and 1590 cm−1, corresponding to the D and G bands. The ID/IG values for the CSs and PCSs-0.075 are 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. This indicates that addition of F127 had little effect on the crystallization degree of the carbon spheres.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"CSs\": \"Reactant\", \"PCs-0.075\": \"Reactant\", \"graphitic carbon\": \"Inorganic\", \"amorphous graphitic carbon\": \"Inorganic\", \"D-band\": \"Reactant\", \"G-band\": \"Reactant\", \"F127\": \"Catalyst\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<CSs,graphitic carbon>\": \"Created from\", \"<CSs,D-band>\": \"Created from\", \"<CSs,G-band>\": \"Created from\", \"<PCs-0.075,amorphous graphitic carbon>\": \"Created from\", \"<F127,CSs>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Besides the hexagonal sheet and the triangular sheet , as well as the buckled triangular sheets , other 2D boron sheets with hexagonal holes, like the α-sheet , β-sheet , γ-sheet , and g1/8 and g2/15 sheets , were examined by the ab initio calculations. It was suggested that the triangular planar boron lattice with hexagonal vacancies is more stable . And a variety of such triangular boron layer with different patterns of hexagonal holes were reported by both the computational and experimental research groups . However, all of these monoatomic-thin boron layers are higher in energy than boron’s three-dimensional (3D) bulk state, which means that the 2D structure of boron is disadvantaged thermodynamically. Thus, a sufficiently “sticky” substrate is necessary to suppress the 3D nucleation barrier to entice the atoms into the 2D route.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"boron nanostructures\": \"Inorganic\", \"hexagonal sheet\": \"Reactant\", \"triangular sheet\": \"Reactant\", \"buckled triangular sheets\": \"Reactant\", \"α-sheet\": \"Reactant\", \"β-sheet\": \"Reactant\", \"γ-sheet\": \"Reactant\", \"g1/8 and g2/15 sheets\": \"Reactant\", \"triangular planar boron lattice with hexagonal vacancies\": \"Reactant\", \"triangular boron layer with different patterns of hexagonal holes\": \"Reactant\", \"monoatomic-thin boron layers\": \"Reactant\", \"3D bulk state\": \"Reactant\", \"2D structure of boron\": \"Reactant\", \"sufficiently “sticky” substrate\": \"Condition\", \"atoms\": \"Reactant\", \"2D route\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<triangular planar boron lattice with hexagonal vacancies,triangular boron layer with different patterns of hexagonal holes>\": \"Created from\", \"<triangular boron layer with different patterns of hexagonal holes,monoatomic-thin boron layers>\": \"Created from\", \"<monoatomic-thin boron layers,3D bulk state>\": \"Created from\", \"<3D bulk state,2D structure of boron>\": \"Created from\", \"<2D structure of boron,sufficiently “sticky” substrate>\": \"Used in\", \"<sufficiently “sticky” substrate,atoms>\": \"Used in\", \"<atoms,2D route>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Consequently, many studies have sought to address this issue by altering the oxygen content of graphene through various modifications of conventional synthesis routes , by changing the precursor graphite’s lateral size  or through novel processing methodologies, such as electrochemical exfoliation . In a previous publication , we reported on an alternative synthetic route for the production of graphene oxide in which the commonly used KMnO4 oxidant was replaced with chromium trioxide (CrO3). The consequence was a reduced degree of oxidation and, as such, the product was termed moderately oxidized graphene oxide (mGO). This system could effectively be introduced without any further treatment into epoxy matrices, for electrical and thermal enhancements, similarly to the eGO systems mentioned above. The work reported here, therefore, sets out to compare the properties of epoxy nanocomposites based upon mGO and commercially available eGO and, specifically, to determine the structure/property relations between the respective graphitic surface chemistries.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"graphite-based composite systems\": \"Reactant\", \"structural and chemical factors\": \"Condition\", \"oxygen content of graphene\": \"Reactant\", \"synthesis routes\": \"Reaction\", \"precursor graphite’s lateral size\": \"Condition\", \"electrochemical exfoliation\": \"Reaction\", \"graphene oxide\": \"Reactant\", \"KMnO4 oxidant\": \"Catalyst\", \"chromium trioxide (CrO3)\": \"Catalyst\", \"moderately oxidized graphene oxide (mGO)\": \"Reactant\", \"epoxy matrices\": \"Reactant\", \"eGO systems\": \"Reactant\", \"epoxy nanocomposites\": \"Reactant\", \"commercially available eGO\": \"Reactant\", \"graphitic surface chemistries\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<graphite-based composite systems,structural and chemical factors>\": \"Created by\", \"<oxygen content of graphene,synthesis routes>\": \"Created from\", \"<graphene oxide,KMnO4 oxidant>\": \"Created from\", \"<graphene oxide,chromium trioxide (CrO3)>\": \"Created from\", \"<moderately oxidized graphene oxide (mGO),epoxy matrices>\": \"Used in\", \"<epoxy nanocomposites,commercially available eGO>\": \"Used in\", \"<epoxy nanocomposites,graphitic surface chemistries>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Indeed, the different polysulfide/β-cyclodextrin complexes can be identified with great sensibility by a unique pattern of events in term of current blockade that increases with increasing the number of sulfur atoms, as intuitively expected. In addition, we could rationalize such an experimental work by molecular docking calculations and Molecular Dynamics simulations that provide evidence for the binding of the polysulfide inside the β-cyclodextrin cavity, as well as for the selective capture of the polysulfide/β-cyclodextrin complexes by the α-HL nanopore.

In particular, DFS shows relatively weak binding of carboxylic acid to the goethite (Fig. 3b, c) and FTIR spectroscopy shows that monocarboxylates bind with goethite through a weakly coordinated solvent-surface hydration-separated ion pair at circumneutral pH30, 31. In experiments using a batch adsorption approach, molecules containing multiple functional groups demonstrated a preference for phosphonic acid groups over amine or carboxylic acid groups32. While DFS did not demonstrate a preference of phosphoric groups over amine groups, physical measurements using CFM found positive correlations between nitrogen-containing aliphatic molecules and (oxy)hydroxide minerals33. This is consistent with the DFS results where stronger binding of the amine functional group compared to the carboxylic acid was observed at pH = 6 in 10 mM NaCl (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the (010) face is the preferred cleavage plane, and thus a low energy face of goethite, which may explain some of the discrepancy between FTIR experiments and DFS and CFM, as FTIR experiments probe all surfaces of the goethite crystals.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"goethite\": \"Inorganic\", \"carboxylic acid\": \"Organic\", \"monocarboxylates\": \"Organic\", \"solvent-surface hydration-separated ion pair\": \"Reactant\", \"phosphonic acid groups\": \"Organic\", \"amine groups\": \"Organic\", \"nitrogen-containing aliphatic molecules\": \"Organic\", \"(oxy)hydroxide minerals\": \"Inorganic\", \"NaCl\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<carboxylic acid,goethite>\": \"Used in\", \"<monocarboxylates,goethite>\": \"Used in\", \"<solvent-surface hydration-separated ion pair,goethite>\": \"Created from\", \"<phosphonic acid groups,goethite>\": \"Used in\", \"<amine groups,goethite>\": \"Used in\", \"<nitrogen-containing aliphatic molecules,(oxy)hydroxide minerals>\": \"Created from\", \"<NaCl,goethite>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

These calculations predicted the most likely dissociation force of the syn dimer in our experiments of 0.95 nN vs. 1.0 nN when the observed forces are analyzed as a discrete distribution with 50-pN-wide bins. The same numbers are 2.0 nN and 2.1 nN for the anti dimer.

Adsorption behaviors of the S-Cu2O for MO were investigated through adsorption kinetic studies, adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic analysis. The selective adsorption abilities of S-Cu2O were evaluated for anionic dye separated from cationic dyes. Adsorption interaction was discussed based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations.

Supplementary Fig. 10 shows the cross sections of F− + (CH3)3CI on the modified PES and those of F− + CH3I on the PES developed by ref. 5 as well as on another PES developed by us. The cross sections of F− + CH3I on two different PESs are consistent, indicating both the two PESs are sufficiently accurate. It is interesting that the \"intrinsic\" SN2 reactivity of (CH3)3CI is even larger than that of CH3I, probably due to the more exothermic energy of (CH3)3CI.

The current is acquired at a constant bias of 50 mV on BP flakes with electrodes in a two-terminal configuration (see experimental section for details). The rate of current decay is fastest under 280 nm exposure (Fig. 4b). Minimal or no current decay is observed upon exposure to higher wavelengths even on extended exposures of up to 8 h. The trend in current decay is consistent with our observations; whereby, the BP flakes exposed to UV shows the highest rate of degradation.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"BP\": \"Reactant\", \"current\": \"Reactant\", \"electrodes\": \"Inorganic\", \"UV\": \"Condition\", \"exposure\": \"Condition\", \"duration\": \"Condition\", \"wavelengths\": \"Condition\", \"bias\": \"Condition\", \"decay\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<BP,current>\": \"Created from\", \"<current,electrodes>\": \"Used in\", \"<UV,decay>\": \"Created by\", \"<exposure,duration>\": \"Along with\", \"<bias,decay>\": \"Created by\", \"<wavelengths,decay>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

A further understanding of this method is very important for establishing a controllable nanofabrication process. In this study, the effect of etching temperature on the formation of protrusive hillocks and surface properties of the etched silicon surface was investigated. It is found that the height of the hillock produced by selective etching increases with the etching temperature before the collapse of the hillock. The temperature-dependent selective etching rate can be fitted well by the Arrhenius equation. The etching at higher temperature can cause rougher silicon surface with a little lower elastic modulus and hardness. The contact angle of the etched silicon surface decreases with the etching temperature. It is also noted that no obvious contamination can be detected on silicon surface after etching at different temperatures. As a result, the optimized condition for the selective etching was addressed. The present study provides a new insight into the control and application of friction-induced selective nanofabrication.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"etching\": \"Reaction\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"silicon surface\": \"Reactant\", \"selective etching\": \"Reaction\", \"Arrhenius equation\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<etching,silicon surface>\": \"Created from\", \"<temperature,etching>\": \"Used in\", \"<Arrhenius equation,etching>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Compound-formation energies are required to predict compound stability, generate phase diagrams, calculate reaction enthalpies and voltages and determine many other material properties. Because this quantity is so ubiquitous, it is important to determine the trustworthiness of our predictions. Although previous large-scale investigations of DFT’s accuracy in predicting formation energies have been performed, these investigations have either been limited in the scope of material type considered41–44 or in the quantity of structures assessed.45 The database of formation energies for 297,099 structures in the OQMD allows for the most comprehensive assessment of the ability of DFT to predict formation energies for solids to date.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"compound\": \"Reactant\", \"formation energy\": \"Condition\", \"DFT\": \"Catalyst\", \"OQMD\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<compound,formation energy>\": \"Created from\", \"<DFT,OQMD>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Here, we introduce monolayer plasmonic chiral Au nanoparticle (NP) films modified with l- or d-penicillamine (Pen) to be developed for cell growth, differentiation, and retrieval. The monolayer films display high chiroptical activity, with circular dichroism values of 3.5 mdeg at 550 nm and 26.8 mdeg at 775 nm. The l-Pen-NP films accelerate cell proliferation, whereas the d-Pen-NP films have the opposite effect. Remote irradiation with light is chosen to noninvasively collect the cells. The results demonstrate that left circularly polarized light improves the efficiency of cell detachment up to 91.2% for l-Pen-NP films. These findings will facilitate the development of cell culture in biomedical application and help to understand natural homochirality.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"chiral materials\": \"Reactant\", \"biological activities\": \"Reaction\", \"cells\": \"Reactant\", \"chemistry\": \"Field of Study\", \"material science\": \"Field of Study\", \"cell biology\": \"Field of Study\", \"biomedicine\": \"Field of Study\", \"monolayer plasmonic chiral Au nanoparticle (NP) films\": \"Reactant\", \"l- or d-penicillamine (Pen)\": \"Reactant\", \"cell growth\": \"Reaction\", \"differentiation\": \"Reaction\", \"retrieval\": \"Reaction\", \"circular dichroism\": \"Condition\", \"light\": \"Condition\", \"left circularly polarized light\": \"Condition\", \"efficiency of cell detachment\": \"Condition\", \"l-Pen-NP films\": \"Reactant\", \"d-Pen-NP films\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<monolayer plasmonic chiral Au nanoparticle (NP) films,l- or d-penicillamine (Pen)>\": \"Created from\", \"<monolayer plasmonic chiral Au nanoparticle (NP) films,cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<l-Pen-NP films,cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<d-Pen-NP films,cells>\": \"Used in\", \"<left circularly polarized light,efficiency of cell detachment>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The material here is differentiated though by a higher MoO3 component indicated by a more significant Mo(VI) signal as well as a substantial oxygen 1 s peak at 530.64 eV 3 along with a relatively low Mo:S ratio of 1:1.3. The inordinate amount of MoO3 contained in the dimer deposit may not stem simply from air oxidation but rather from the deposition process itself. High local concentration of OH− at the electrode would support oxide formation so the deposition process can be envisioned to include hydrolysis of the dimer’s oxo to OH− by TFA protons. Deposition likely also involves the same type of sulfur rearrangement via HS− expulsion which occurs in formation of the similar amorphous MoS2 material .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"MoS2\": \"Reactant\", \"MoS42−\": \"Reactant\", \"cathodic electrolysis\": \"Reaction\", \"MoO3\": \"Reactant\", \"Mo(VI)\": \"Reactant\", \"oxygen\": \"Inorganic\", \"OH−\": \"Reactant\", \"TFA protons\": \"Reactant\", \"HS−\": \"Reactant\", \"amorphous MoS2\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<MoS2,MoS42−>\": \"Created from\", \"<MoO3,Mo(VI)>\": \"Created from\", \"<OH−,TFA protons>\": \"Created from\", \"<HS−,amorphous MoS2>\": \"Created from\", \"<cathodic electrolysis,MoS2>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

Thus, ligands with the potential for E-selectivity were proposed based on a small ensemble of multivariable linear regression models, as well as proximity in chemical space. In line with the philosophy of combining exploitation and exploration, we chose six additional ligands that included structures both similar (e.g., L33, L34), and different (e.g. L36, L37) to any ligand in the training set, as well as predictions with low certainty (L38). Manual experiments employing these ligands were carried out utilizing the optimal conditions identified from autonomous optimization to measure the selectivity outcome (Fig. 10, see Supplementary Information Predictive Modeling section and Fig. SI-11 through SI-15 for details). In addition, L30 was employed in a control experiment.Fig. 10Manual experiments under optimized conditions with predicted E-selective ligands.Conditions: 10 µmol 1-E, 1 µmol 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 15 µmol (3-(benzyloxy)phenyl)boronic acid 3, 0.4 µmol Pd(ACN)2Cl2, 0.9 µmol L, 30 µmol K3PO4 (0.5 M aq) in ACN (0.05 M), 2 h at 35 °C.

The main focus of the present work was to fabricate and evaluate the stability of CH3NH3PbBr3 quantum dot (QD)-based perovskite solar cells. We used an ex situ solution process to synthesize CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs and then successfully fabricated mesoscopic solid-state perovskite solar cells. We also studied the influence of different CH3NH3PbBr3 QD sizes and different hole-transporting materials (HTMs), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) and poly (PTAA), on the solar cell performance. The size of the CH3NH3PbBr3 QDs was controlled by the solution processing parameters. Our controlled results show that spiro-MeOTAD- and PTAA-based devices exhibited, respectively, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.991 and 1.091 V and a current density (JSC) of 11.68 and 12.05 mA cm−2, which resulted in an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.35 and 9.44% under a standard 100 mW cm−2 illumination without masking. Our best-performing cell, which contains the FTO/Bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2+CH3NH3PbBr3 (~2-nm QDs)/PTAA/Au configuration shows the following results: open-circuit voltage (VOC)=1.110 V, current density (JSC)=14.07 mA cm−2, fill factor=0.73 and an 11.40% PCE.

Its alloy was entirely covered by thick layers of corrosion products and accretions, which are clearly demonstrated in the EDS spectrum (Fig. 9a). In this spectrum, only the elements of the accretions layers are observed (C, O, Al, Si, Ca) almost totally masking the chemical elements of the alloy (Cu, Ni). After the laser cleaning process, the elements of the alloy are fully revealed with concentration of Cu = 79.87 wt% and Ni = 16.37 wt% that approach the reference concentration (Cu = 75 wt%, Ni = 25 wt%). The divergence is due to the cuprite layer that still remains on the surface of the coin, of which oxygen changes the absolute and relative concentrations of the cleaned surface. Further minimization of the cuprite layer was not an option because of the already strong corrosion, visible as intense roughness of the surface of the coin, which already affects the details of the coin’s engravings.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"corrosion\": \"Reaction\", \"alloy\": \"Reactant\", \"cuprite layer\": \"Reactant\", \"oxygen\": \"Reactant\", \"concentration\": \"Condition\", \"laser cleaning process\": \"Condition\", \"surface\": \"Condition\", \"coin\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<corrosion,alloy>\": \"Created from\", \"<cuprite layer,oxygen>\": \"Created from\", \"<laser cleaning process,surface>\": \"Used in\", \"<concentration,coin>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

The percentage of sterols was also approximately twofold higher by the time the cells entered stationary phase compared to early exponential phase. In contrast, phospholipid proportions remained essentially unchanged, which was reflected by a pronounced increase in TAGs/phospholipids ratio compared to S. cerevisiae  or Y. lipolytica . The high TAGs/phospholipid ratio in R. toruloides suggested that the accumulated neutral lipids are stored in giant lipid droplets rather than the cell membrane. The R. toruloides lipid droplet proteome was shown to drive a formation of giant lipid droplets in this organism .

However, lignin is composed of diverse monolignols with different abundance levels in different plant biomass and requires different proportions of ligninase to realize efficient degradation. To improve activity and reduce cost, the simultaneous submerged fermentation of laccase and lignin peroxidase (LiP) from a new bacterial strain, Streptomyces cinnamomensis, was studied by adopting formulation design, principal component analysis, regression analysis and unconstrained mathematical programming.ResultsThe activities of laccase and LiP from S. cinnamomensis cultured with the optimal medium formulations were improved to be five to eight folders of their initial activities, and the measured laccase:LiP activity ratios reached 0.1, 0.4 and 1.7 when cultured on medium with formulations designed to produce laccase:LiP complexes with theoretical laccase:LiP activity ratios of 0.05 to 0.1, 0.5 to 1 and 1.1 to 2.ConclusionBoth the laccase and LiP activities and also the activity ratio of laccase to LiP could be controlled by the medium formulation as designed. Using a crude laccase-LiP complex with a specially designed laccase:LiP activity ratio has the potential to improve the degradation of various plant lignins composed of diverse monolignols with different abundance levels.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ligninase\": \"Catalyst\", \"lignocellulosic biomass\": \"Reactant\", \"laccase\": \"Catalyst\", \"lignin peroxidase\": \"Catalyst\", \"Streptomyces cinnamomensis\": \"Organic\", \"medium formulations\": \"Condition\", \"laccase-LiP complex\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<laccase,lignin peroxidase>\": \"Used in\", \"<laccase-LiP complex,ligninase>\": \"Created from\", \"<laccase-LiP complex,medium formulations>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

However, supplementation with acetate modulates gene expression and metabolic flux in C. thermocellum ΔhydG by an unknown mechanism. Because of the role of hydrogenases in reoxidizing ferredoxin, deletion of hydG could reasonably affect flux through PFOR to perturb pools of acetyl-CoA and acetyl-phosphate, which are known to acetylate proteins to alter enzymatic properties in some organisms . However, no difference in protein acetylation was observed in ΔhydG either in the presence or absence of added acetate, suggesting that differential protein acetylation is not the likely mechanism by which sulfate reduction genes are more highly expressed. Thus, the mechanism of gene upregulation remains to be elucidated.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"acetate\": \"Reactant\", \"wild-type cultures\": \"Reactant\", \"gene expression\": \"Reaction\", \"metabolic flux\": \"Reaction\", \"hydrogenases\": \"Catalyst\", \"ferredoxin\": \"Reactant\", \"acetyl-CoA\": \"Reactant\", \"acetyl-phosphate\": \"Reactant\", \"protein acetylation\": \"Reaction\", \"sulfate reduction genes\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<acetate,wild-type cultures>\": \"Used in\", \"<acetate,gene expression>\": \"Used in\", \"<acetate,metabolic flux>\": \"Used in\", \"<hydrogenases,ferredoxin>\": \"Used in\", \"<acetyl-CoA,protein acetylation>\": \"Created from\", \"<acetyl-phosphate,protein acetylation>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

This small-scale constraining was sufficient to demonstrate the potential of this approach with the experimental data used, but larger-scale constraining would be expected to provide benefits for the prediction of reactions and metabolic engineering targets outside of central carbon metabolism. The limitations of small-scale constraining were apparent in the gene essentiality predictions for genes outside of central carbon metabolism, which were not affected by enzyme constraints for central carbon metabolic reactions. The primary challenge for developing constraints for reactions outside of central carbon metabolism is the limited availability of enzyme kinetic data for even relatively well-characterized organisms like B. subtilis. The poor availability of high quality enzyme kinetic data has been identified as a major impediment for developing improved computational models of cellular metabolism in general .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"reactions\": \"Reaction\", \"enzyme kinetic data\": \"Condition\", \"enzymes\": \"Catalyst\", \"central carbon metabolism\": \"Organic\", \"B. subtilis\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<reactions,enzyme kinetic data>\": \"Created by\", \"<enzymes,reactions>\": \"Used in\", \"<central carbon metabolism,reactions>\": \"Created from\", \"<B. subtilis,enzyme kinetic data>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

However, their fluorescence suffers from an intrinsic drawback due to aggregation-caused quenching. Commercially available NIR cyanine dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG) and IR780, are known to show concentration-dependent quenching at concentrations greater than 1 μM (Supplementary Fig. 1). In the case of ICG, fluorescence loss can reach up to 80% at 4 μM. For cyclohexylamine-substituted cyanine, CyP7-CH, 55% fluorescence loss was observed at 4 μM (Supplementary Fig. 2). While fluorescence is favored in organic fluorophores with large conjugated and rigid planar systems, such structures are also prone to aggregation due to π–π stacking. As such, we hypothesized that introducing steric hindrance to the cyanine-based fluorophores would disrupt π–π stacking, thus presenting a simple and effective way to achieve favorable fluorescence properties for various bioimaging applications. Herein, we report a bioorthogonally activatable NIR cyanine-based probe for in vivo tumor imaging via TIDA.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"cyanine derivatives\": \"Organic\", \"indocyanine green (ICG)\": \"Organic\", \"IR780\": \"Organic\", \"cyclohexylamine-substituted cyanine\": \"Organic\", \"CyP7-CH\": \"Organic\", \"fluorescence\": \"Reaction\", \"concentration\": \"Condition\", \"steric hindrance\": \"Condition\", \"NIR cyanine-based probe\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<fluorescence,concentration>\": \"Along with\", \"<fluorescence,steric hindrance>\": \"Created by\", \"<NIR cyanine-based probe,cyanine derivatives>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

The samples were immersed in the solution for 2 days to form a stable passive layer on the surface of the sample. Before the tests, absolute ethanol and de-ionized water were used to remove the residual corrosion liquid from the surface, and Ar+ (30 s) was used to remove the surface contaminants. The charge correction method is corrected by the charge neutralization gun built into the gold conducting device, and the band pass energy is 40 eV. XPSPEAK software was used to fit the XPS curves of the XPS test results. The cross-sectional structure of the passive film formed by the sample at a stable OCP for 3600 s was observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI Titan G260-300).

In the mitochondrion the precursors for citrate synthase are oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. Oxaloacetate is produced from pyruvate by the action of cytosolic pyruvate carboxylase. There are different mechanisms by which acetyl-CoA can be synthesized in the cytosol . How these pathways, which are also largely compartmentalized, contribute to the IA production in our strains goes clearly beyond the topic of this paper and is subject of our ongoing research (Hossain et al. in preparation).

Here we present a new data set for fine-grained sediment (<63 μm) from the Yangtze River and its major tributaries, which represents a baseline for interpreting sediment in the East China Sea. We demonstrate that there is no significant coherent downstream variation in the major element contents, which are generally more enriched than the average upper continental crust, except for water-soluble elements including Sr, Rb, Na, and K. Nd isotopes show that most of the sediment comes from the eastern and middle Yangtze Craton, as well as the Songpan-Garze Terrane. Chemical weathering varies significantly across the basin with upstream tributary sediments being relatively unweathered compared to those in the lower reaches. However, sediments in the main Yangtze stream show no trend in chemical weathering along its course, with some of the least weathered materials being found closest to the delta. Grain size and the abundance of hydrodynamically sorted heavy minerals affect the bulk geochemistry, especially the rare earth elements (REEs).","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"sediment\": \"Reactant\", \"chemical weathering\": \"Reaction\", \"water-soluble elements\": \"Inorganic\", \"Yangtze River\": \"Reactant\", \"East China Sea\": \"Reactant\", \"upper continental crust\": \"Reactant\", \"Songpan-Garze Terrane\": \"Reactant\", \"Yangtze stream\": \"Reactant\", \"delta\": \"Reactant\", \"grain size\": \"Condition\", \"hydrodynamically sorted heavy minerals\": \"Condition\", \"rare earth elements\": \"Inorganic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<sediment,chemical weathering>\": \"Created from\", \"<Yangtze River,East China Sea>\": \"Used in\", \"<upper continental crust,Songpan-Garze Terrane>\": \"Created by\", \"<Yangtze stream,delta>\": \"Used in\", \"<grain size,rare earth elements>\": \"Along with\", \"<hydrodynamically sorted heavy minerals,rare earth elements>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

However, the obtained fluffy product was porous but almost amorphous (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10), illustrating the one-pot strategy was not feasible for the construction of such a complex network. Moreover, we also tried to synthesize the imine-linked DBAAn-HAPB-COF as a parent network to realize pore partitioning (Supplementary Fig. 11), while it was obtained as an amorphous and nonporous powder (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). Even though the amorphous DBAAn-HAPB-COF was delivered to the subsequent reaction with C3-symmetry BTBA (Supplementary Fig. 11), the resulting DBAAn-BTBA-HAPB-COF was also proved amorphous and nonporous (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15).

The activity of the prepared Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst was evaluated in a down flow fixed-bed micro-reactor. In this way, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) reactions of the main distillate fractions of crude oil were assessed. XRD, SEM, TPR, ICP-OES, BET–BJH and nitrogen adsorption/desorption methods were used for characterizing the synthesized Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst. The active metals with Ni/Mo mass ratio of 0.23 and total metal of 13.7 wt% were loaded on the support, similar to the commercial industrial catalyst. The performance tests were conducted at 3.0 MPa (for light naphtha and heavy naphtha) and at 4.5 MPa (for kerosene and gas oil). The results revealed that the total sulfur conversion of the light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene and gas oil fractions was 98.3%, 95%, 91.7% and 90.1% (after 24 h), respectively.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"nickel–molybdenum catalyst\": \"Catalyst\", \"Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst\": \"Catalyst\", \"hydrodesulfurization (HDS)\": \"Reaction\", \"hydrodenitrogenation (HDN)\": \"Reaction\", \"crude oil\": \"Reactant\", \"light naphtha\": \"Reactant\", \"heavy naphtha\": \"Reactant\", \"kerosene\": \"Reactant\", \"gas oil\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst,hydrodesulfurization (HDS)>\": \"Used in\", \"<Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst,hydrodenitrogenation (HDN)>\": \"Used in\", \"<Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst,light naphtha>\": \"Used in\", \"<Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst,heavy naphtha>\": \"Used in\", \"<Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst,kerosene>\": \"Used in\", \"<Ni–Mo/γ-alumina catalyst,gas oil>\": \"Used in\"}} "}

They have been used mainly for the functionalisation of nanomaterials but little is known about their use for the immobilisation of thermostable enzymes and their feasibility in industrial-scale biocatalysis.ResultsA silica-binding SBP sequence was fused genetically to three thermostable hemicellulases. The resulting enzymes were active after fusion and exhibited identical pH and temperature optima but differing thermostabilities when compared to their corresponding unmodified enzymes. The silica-binding peptide mediated the efficient immobilisation of each enzyme onto zeolite, demonstrating the construction of single enzyme biocatalytic modules. Cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) of enzyme preparations either with or without zeolite immobilisation displayed greater activity retention during enzyme recycling than those of free enzymes (without silica-binding peptide) or zeolite-bound enzymes without any crosslinking. CLEA preparations comprising all three enzymes simultaneously immobilised onto zeolite enabled the formation of multiple enzyme biocatalytic modules which were shown to degrade several hemicellulosic substrates.ConclusionsThe current work introduced the construction of functional biocatalytic modules for the hydrolysis of simple and complex polysaccharides. This technology exploited a silica-binding SBP to mediate effectively the rapid and simple immobilisation of thermostable enzymes onto readily-available and inexpensive silica-based matrices. A conceptual application of biocatalytic modules consisting of single or multiple enzymes was validated by hydrolysing various hemicellulosic polysaccharides.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"solid-binding peptides\": \"Reactant\", \"silica-binding SBP\": \"Reactant\", \"thermostable enzymes\": \"Reactant\", \"zeolite\": \"Inorganic\", \"enzyme recycling\": \"Reaction\", \"hydrolysis\": \"Reaction\", \"hemicellulosic polysaccharides\": \"Organic\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<silica-binding SBP,thermostable enzymes>\": \"Used in\", \"<thermostable enzymes,hemicellulosic polysaccharides>\": \"Created from\", \"<zeolite,enzyme recycling>\": \"Used in\", \"<enzyme recycling,hydrolysis>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

We also studied the influence of different 2-naphthol concentrations in the pretreatment on subsequent simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for the production of ethanol from softwood. This is of interest as the addition of 2-naphthol at concentrations higher than 0.1 g/l led to reduced ethanol yields in glucose fermentations . To elucidate the effect of 2-naphthol added to the pretreatment stage, SSF experiments were performed at a cellulose concentration of 1 and 5% w/w using washed solids, filtered solids, and whole pretreatment slurries.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"hemicellulose fraction\": \"Reactant\", \"soluble sugars\": \"Reactant\", \"2-naphthol\": \"Reactant\", \"cellulose\": \"Reactant\", \"ethanol\": \"Reactant\", \"glucose\": \"Reactant\", \"softwood\": \"Reactant\", \"steam pretreatment process\": \"Reaction\", \"simultaneous saccharification and fermentation\": \"Reaction\", \"concentration of 2-naphthol\": \"Condition\", \"concentration of cellulose\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<2-naphthol,simultaneous saccharification and fermentation>\": \"Used in\", \"<2-naphthol,ethanol>\": \"Created from\", \"<concentration of 2-naphthol,ethanol>\": \"Along with\", \"<concentration of cellulose,ethanol>\": \"Along with\", \"<hemicellulose fraction,soluble sugars>\": \"Created from\", \"<steam pretreatment process,hemicellulose fraction>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Most likely, readily degradable polymers such as starch (in MS) or hemicellulose were degraded at all HRTs, whereas degradation of recalcitrant crystalline cellulose-lignin structures was limited by the low pH-value, as it was described for various cellulolytic microorganisms . However, with the mixed straw feedstock, significantly increased gas production (+ 237% with 30% straw) might have led to an underestimation of the SHY. The AY was increased at a longer HRT, especially with a higher content of recalcitrant feedstock (+ 20% with 66% straw). Contrary effects of the HRT on AY were found with 30% straw, possibly due to the different microbial activity with a preferred lactic acid production. The increase of the AY in parallel with the HRT was described before for the acidogenic digestion of kitchen waste , food waste  and the co-digestion of primary and waste activated sludge .","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"hydrolysis yield\": \"Reaction\", \"HRT\": \"Condition\", \"starch\": \"Organic\", \"hemicellulose\": \"Organic\", \"cellulose-lignin\": \"Organic\", \"pH-value\": \"Condition\", \"microbial activity\": \"Condition\", \"lactic acid\": \"Organic\", \"acidogenic digestion\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<hydrolysis yield,HRT>\": \"Created by\", \"<starch,hydrolysis yield>\": \"Used in\", \"<hemicellulose,hydrolysis yield>\": \"Used in\", \"<cellulose-lignin,hydrolysis yield>\": \"Used in\", \"<pH-value,cellulose-lignin>\": \"Created by\", \"<microbial activity,lactic acid>\": \"Created from\", \"<acidogenic digestion,lactic acid>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Before the synthesis of PEGS, we first prepared a catalyst, bis(tetrabutylammonium) sebacate (TBAS), as previously reported. Briefly, sebacic acid (0.98 g) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH; 10.00 g, ~ 25 wt% in H2O) were dissolved in 95% ethanol (50 ml) and reacted for 30 min at 55 °C under continuous stirring. The mixture was treated with rotary evaporation and lyophilization sequentially to obtain TBAS as a white powder. Then, sebacic acid (5.06 g), PEGDGE (12.50 g) and the catalyst TBAS (0.11) were dissolved in anhydrous DMF (50 ml) under nitrogen protection and stirred for 72 h at 100 °C.

Such reports which investigated the feasibility of the growth of single crystals of the apatite-type of oxide ionic conductors were given by Nakayama et al. In 2013, they reported on the growth of single crystals of hexagonal apatite-type La9.33Si6O26  by seeding with a single crystal of the same composition grown by the Cz method. As in the previous studies involving the SSCG method, the authors observed an abrupt motion of the grain boundary from the seed crystal with a low surface energy to a polycrystalline area with higher surface energy due to the seed crystal consuming the smaller, fine grains. In the same year, the authors reported on another study on apatite-type oxide La9.33Ge6O26  grown as a single crystal by the SSCG method. Compared to the previous, La9.33Ge6O26 exhibited much less conductive anisotropy.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"SSCG method\": \"Reaction\", \"single crystals\": \"Reactant\", \"apatite-type of oxide ionic conductors\": \"Reactant\", \"La9.33Si6O26\": \"Reactant\", \"Cz method\": \"Condition\", \"grain boundary\": \"Condition\", \"surface energy\": \"Condition\", \"polycrystalline area\": \"Condition\", \"La9.33Ge6O26\": \"Reactant\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<SSCG method,single crystals>\": \"Created from\", \"<Cz method,La9.33Si6O26>\": \"Created from\", \"<grain boundary,polycrystalline area>\": \"Created by\", \"<surface energy,polycrystalline area>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

A mixture of TFMS and methanol (MeOH) (TFMS–MeOH (V:V = 1:10)), followed by pure methanol was used to treat PEDOT:PSS films. In detail, 200 μL of liquid (TFMS–MeOH) was dropped onto a PEDOT:PSS thin film heated at 130 °C. The film was dried for about 30 min, and then the dried film was washed by dipping in methanol for three times. Finally, the 50 nm PEDOT:PSS thin film was obtained and used directly for next-step use. A set of ITO films with different electrical and thermal properties was fabricated by radio frequency magnetron sputtering using a hydrogen–argon or oxygen–argon gas mixture at a process temperature of about 60 °C, as shown in Table 1.

More specifically, a phyto-engineering approach using green nano-chemistry and agro-waste in the form of avocado seed natural extract was utilized as a green, economic, and eco-friendly approach to synthesize this unique mineral at the nanoscale via the reduction of iron (II) sulphate heptahydrate. The nanoproduct which was found to exhibit a quasi-2D structure was characterized using a multi-technique approach to describe its morphological, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic properties. Radial distribution function and electrostatic potential maps revealed that flavone, a phenolic compound within the avocado seed natural extract, has a higher affinity of interaction with the nanoparticle's surface, whilst vanillic acid has a higher wetting tendency and thus a lower affinity for interacting with the hydronium jarosite nanoparticle surface compared to other phytoactive compounds. XRD and HRTEM results indicated that the nanoscale product was representative of crystalline rhombohedral hydronium jarosite in the form of quasi-triangular nanosheets decorated on the edges with nanoparticles of approximately 5.4 nm diameter that exhibited significant electrochemical and electroconductive behaviours. Magnetic studies further showed a diamagnetic behaviour based on the relationship of the inverse susceptibility of the nanomaterial with temperature sweep.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"molecular dynamics computational modelling\": \"Condition\", \"nano-scaled 2-D hydronium jarosite\": \"Reactant\", \"phyto-engineering approach\": \"Condition\", \"green nano-chemistry\": \"Condition\", \"agro-waste\": \"Reactant\", \"avocado seed natural extract\": \"Reactant\", \"iron (II) sulphate heptahydrate\": \"Reactant\", \"nanoparticle's surface\": \"Reactant\", \"flavone\": \"Organic\", \"vanillic acid\": \"Organic\", \"crystalline rhombohedral hydronium jarosite\": \"Reactant\", \"quasi-triangular nanosheets\": \"Reactant\", \"nanoparticles\": \"Reactant\", \"electrochemical and electroconductive behaviours\": \"Condition\", \"temperature sweep\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<molecular dynamics computational modelling,nano-scaled 2-D hydronium jarosite>\": \"Created by\", \"<phyto-engineering approach,green nano-chemistry>\": \"Used in\", \"<avocado seed natural extract,iron (II) sulphate heptahydrate>\": \"Created from\", \"<flavone,nanoparticle's surface>\": \"Used in\", \"<vanillic acid,hydronium jarosite nanoparticle surface>\": \"Used in\", \"<crystalline rhombohedral hydronium jarosite,quasi-triangular nanosheets>\": \"Created from\", \"<quasi-triangular nanosheets,nanoparticles>\": \"Created from\", \"<nanoparticles,electrochemical and electroconductive behaviours>\": \"Created by\", \"<electrochemical and electroconductive behaviours,temperature sweep>\": \"Along with\"}} "}

However, this phenomenon is mostly limited to solid inorganic materials. Here, we report photostimulated luminescence from purely organic blend films, composed of electron donor, acceptor, and trap/emitter molecules. Charges in the films are accumulated as radical ions by ultraviolet light irradiation and then extracted by near-infrared light irradiation. Even after storage in the dark for one week they produce visible light with good repeatability, color tunability, and are responsive to weak external magnetic fields. These findings might broadly impact existing applications and provide new prospects for innovative flexible devices.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"photostimulated luminescence\": \"Reaction\", \"energy\": \"Reactant\", \"data\": \"Reactant\", \"electromagnetic waves\": \"Condition\", \"solid inorganic materials\": \"Inorganic\", \"organic blend films\": \"Organic\", \"electron donor\": \"Reactant\", \"acceptor\": \"Reactant\", \"trap/emitter molecules\": \"Reactant\", \"radical ions\": \"Reactant\", \"ultraviolet light\": \"Condition\", \"near-infrared light\": \"Condition\", \"visible light\": \"Reactant\", \"weak external magnetic fields\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<photostimulated luminescence,energy>\": \"Created from\", \"<photostimulated luminescence,data>\": \"Created from\", \"<organic blend films,electron donor>\": \"Created from\", \"<organic blend films,acceptor>\": \"Created from\", \"<organic blend films,trap/emitter molecules>\": \"Created from\", \"<radical ions,ultraviolet light>\": \"Created by\", \"<visible light,near-infrared light>\": \"Created by\", \"<visible light,weak external magnetic fields>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

To revisit the problem of predicting the geometries for these uncharacterized molecules, G2S has been trained on 5000 randomly chosen QM9 molecules (varying constitution and composition), and used to predict coordinates for each of them. Subsequent geometry optimization at a B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory showed successful convergence of 90% of them (a random selection of unconverged molecules can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 7). A similar success rate has been reached with Gen3D6 and OpenBabel. Figure 3f depicts randomly drawn structures together with the respective structural formula.

There is an urgent need for advanced strategies to overcome the current limitations of platinum-based chemotherapy, to achieve maximal therapeutic outcomes with reduced side effects. In this study, self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs) were tailored for efficient chemo-photoimmunotherapy of BC. PtPDs with high Pt loading content (11.3%) were degradable under the combination of a reductive tumor microenvironment and near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, thus controlling the release of Pt ions to achieve efficient chemotherapy. In addition, polydopamine promoted stronger photothermal effects to supplement platinum-based chemotherapy. Consequently, PtPDs provided effective chemo-photothermal therapy of MB49 BC in vitro and in vivo, strengthening the immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect and robust anti-tumoral immunity response. When combined with a PD-1 checkpoint blockade, PtPD-based photochemotherapy evoked systemic immune responses that completely suppressed primary and distant tumor growth without inducing systemic toxicities. Our work provides a highly versatile approach through metal-dopamine self-polymerization for the precise delivery of metal-based chemotherapeutic drugs, and may serve as a promising nanomedicine for efficient and safe platinum-based chemotherapy for BC.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"platinum-based drugs\": \"Reactant\", \"advanced bladder cancer\": \"Reactant\", \"self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs)\": \"Reactant\", \"reductive tumor microenvironment\": \"Condition\", \"near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation\": \"Condition\", \"Pt ions\": \"Reactant\", \"polydopamine\": \"Reactant\", \"MB49 BC\": \"Reactant\", \"PD-1 checkpoint blockade\": \"Reactant\", \"metal-dopamine self-polymerization\": \"Reaction\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs),reductive tumor microenvironment>\": \"Created by\", \"<self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs),near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation>\": \"Created by\", \"<self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs),Pt ions>\": \"Created from\", \"<self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs),MB49 BC>\": \"Used in\", \"<self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs),PD-1 checkpoint blockade>\": \"Used in\", \"<self-polymerized platinum (II)-polydopamine nanocomplexes (PtPDs),metal-dopamine self-polymerization>\": \"Created from\"}} "}

Chemical coagulants such as ferric chloride, calcium hydroxide, alum, ferric sulfate, ferrous sulfate, polyaluminium chloride, and lime (Amokrane et al. 1997; Graham et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2010; De Godos et al. 2011; Imran et al. 2012) have been widely used in removing a wide range of particles from wastewater. Nevertheless, these chemical coagulants have disadvantages, which include large volume of sludge resulting in huge disposal cost, not being effective in low-temperature water, and high procurement cost. Furthermore, aluminum-based coagulants are associated with Alzheimer disease in humans (Moraes 2004; Chen et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2011).","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"coagulation–flocculation process\": \"Reaction\", \"coagulant type\": \"Catalyst\", \"raw effluent quality\": \"Condition\", \"temperature\": \"Condition\", \"pH\": \"Condition\", \"chemical coagulants\": \"Reactant\", \"ferric chloride\": \"Reactant\", \"calcium hydroxide\": \"Reactant\", \"alum\": \"Reactant\", \"ferric sulfate\": \"Reactant\", \"ferrous sulfate\": \"Reactant\", \"polyaluminium chloride\": \"Reactant\", \"lime\": \"Reactant\", \"sludge\": \"Reactant\", \"Alzheimer disease\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<coagulant type,coagulation–flocculation process>\": \"Used in\", \"<chemical coagulants,coagulation–flocculation process>\": \"Used in\", \"<ferric chloride,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<calcium hydroxide,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<alum,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<ferric sulfate,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<ferrous sulfate,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<polyaluminium chloride,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<lime,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<sludge,chemical coagulants>\": \"Created from\", \"<Alzheimer disease,ferric chloride>\": \"Created by\", \"<Alzheimer disease,alum>\": \"Created by\", \"<Alzheimer disease,polyaluminium chloride>\": \"Created by\"}} "}

Initial electrochemical characterisation of the interphase formed in these systems has shown low electrode–electrolyte impedance. Work is underway to more extensively characterise this interphase, as it is seen as critical for controlling Na electrochemistry by halting corrosive side reactions while still allowing Na+ transport during battery operation.","name":"las_5e-5","target":"{\"Entities\": {\"ionic liquid electrolytes\": \"Reactant\", \"lithium electrolytes\": \"Reactant\", \"LiFSI salt\": \"Reactant\", \"phosphonium-based ionic liquid\": \"Reactant\", \"P111i4FSI\": \"Reactant\", \"NaFSI\": \"Reactant\", \"interphase\": \"Reactant\", \"electrode–electrolyte impedance\": \"Condition\", \"battery operation\": \"Condition\"}, \"Relations\": {\"<ionic liquid electrolytes,lithium electrolytes>\": \"Created from\", \"<lithium electrolytes,LiFSI salt>\": \"Created from\", \"<LiFSI salt,phosphonium-based ionic liquid>\": \"Used in\", \"<phosphonium-based ionic liquid,P111i4FSI>\": \"Created from\", \"<P111i4FSI,interphase>\": \"Created from\", \"<interphase,electrode–electrolyte impedance>\": \"Along with\", \"<interphase,battery operation>\": \"Along with\", \"<NaFSI,interphase>\": \"Used in\"}} "}
