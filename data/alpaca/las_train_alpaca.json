        "input": "BackgroundRhodamine B (RhB) is widely used as a colorant in textiles and food stuffs, and is also a well-known water tracer fluorescent. It is harmful to human beings and animals, and causes irritation of the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. The carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity and chronic toxicity toward humans and animals have been experimentally proven. RhB cannot be effectively removed by biological treatment due to the slow kinetics. Therefore, RhB is chosen as a model pollutant for liquid phase plasma (LPP) treatment in the present investigation.ResultsThis paper presents experimental results for the bleaching of RhB from aqueous solutions in the presence of TiO2 photocatalyst with LPP system. Properties of generated plasma were investigated by optical emission spectroscopy methods. The results of electrical-discharge degradation of RhB showed that the decomposition rate increased with the applied voltage, pulse width, and frequency. The oxygen gas addition to reactant solution increases the degradation rate by active oxygen species. The RhB decomposition rate was shown to increase with the TiO2 particle dosage.ConclusionThis work presents the conclusions on the photocatalytic oxidation of RhB, as a function of plasma conditions, oxygen gas bubbling as well as TiO2 particle dosage. We knew that using the liquid phase plasma system with TiO2 photocatalyst at high speed we could remove the organic matter in the water.",

Additionally, few researchers have tried to strengthen the heterologous protein expression ability in P. pastoris from the perspective of improving their oxidative stress tolerance. Indeed, many other researchers have successfully increased the production efficiency of yeast strains by relieving repression and improving their stress tolerance.

        "input": "IC50 is concentration of antioxidant required to quench 50% of the initial radical, which can be applied to evaluate antioxidant capacity of different substrates. IC50 values of S-L for DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging were 0.46 g/L and 0.91 g/L, which were lower than that of XOS with the value of 1.1 g/L and 1.7 g/L. These results indicate that S-L exhibits better performance for scavenging free radicals than XOS. This can be attributed to that the obtained S-L is predominantly lignin, which has abundant content of phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups that benefit for scavenging radicals.

        "input": "BackgroundProduct inhibition can reduce catalytic performance of enzymes used for biofuel production. Different mechanisms can cause this inhibition and, in most cases, the use of classical enzymology approach is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Here we have used a semi-rational protein fusion strategy to create a product-stimulated enzyme.ResultsA semi-rational protein fusion strategy was used to create a protein fusion library where the Bacillus subtilis GH11 xylanase A (XynA) was inserted at 144 surface positions of the Escherichia coli xylose binding protein (XBP). Two XynA insertions at XBP positions 209 ([209]XBP-Xyn-XBP) and 262 ([262]XBP-Xyn-XBP) showed a 20% increased xylanolytic activity in the presence of xylose, conditions where native XynA is inhibited. Random linkers of 1-4 Gly/Ala residues were inserted at the XynA N- and C-termini in the [209]XBP and [262]XBP, and the chimeras 2091A and 2621B were isolated, showing a twofold increased xylanolytic activity in the presence of xylose and kcat values of 200 and 240 s−1 in the 2091A and 2621B, respectively, as compared to 70 s−1 in the native XynA. The xylose affinity of the XBP was unchanged in the chimeras, showing that the ~3- to 3.5-fold stimulation of catalytic efficiency by xylose was the result of allosteric coupling between the XBP and XynA domains. Molecular dynamics simulations of the chimeras suggested conformation alterations in the XynA on xylose binding to the XBP resulted in exposure of the catalytic cavity and increased mobility of catalytic site residues as compared to the native XynA.ConclusionsThese results are the first report of engineered glycosyl hydrolase showing allosteric product stimulation and suggest that the strategy may be more widely employed to overcome enzyme product inhibition and to improve catalytic performance.Graphical abstractProtein fusion of a GH11 xylanase (in red) and a xylose binding protein (XBP, in blue) results in a xylanase-XBP chimera that presents allosteric activation of the xylanase activity by xylose (shown as a space-filled molecule bound to the xylanase-XBP chimera)",

It was observed that the larger center-to-center spacing between DABCYL and the Qdot was relatively larger than that of 6-Fam/DABCYL. This difference was attributed to the larger size effect of the Qdots which also influenced its FRET efficiency of the Qdots and the Förster radius between the Qdot and DABCYL. Since this study was limited to a single Qdot size, the quantum size effect of Qdots which could yield several sizes across the visible region to the near infra-red will have a profound effect on the interaction with quencher molecules in MB assays.",

Though the method is based on isotopic exchange of 18F for 19F, the product is obtained with high molar activity since only very low amounts of the corresponding 19F-precursor are required. By the nature of the labelling step almost no by-products are formed and therefore purification can be realized by a simple cartridge method instead of semipreparative HPLC. The short time required for the labelling reaction (5 min) and the application of a cartridge method for drying of the starting activity fluoride as well as simple purification of the final product contribute to an appealing overall synthesis time of 22 min only.

After treatments, the surface layer with a thickness of ~2 μm is depleted in Mn element. The depletion thickness is far beyond the equilibrium value (nm scale for equilibrium segregation), thus it belongs to non-equilibrium surface depletion. A similar phenomenon has been found for some industrial high-strength Al alloys such as AA 202414, AA 7075, AA 715015, and AA 703416. The induced massive defects like grain boundaries and dislocation pipes are short circuit diffusion pathways for alloy atoms, which can make the diffusion rate 10 orders of magnitude higher than that in lattice39–43. The relatively long-distance surface depletion is a result of atoms diffusing from subsurface to surface along those short circuit diffusion pathways16.

Likewise, abnormalities in metal-binding proteins are a key factor in promoting the erroneous distribution and deposition of metal ions in the brain . Some of the mechanisms by which metal ions promote these abnormalities are the induction of oxidative stress, autophagy dysfunctions, the disruption of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria structures, activation of β- or γ-secretases, inhibition of α-secretase, and activation of protein kinases such as cyclin-dependent protein kinase-5 (CDK5), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), etc. . Moreover, all these alterations enhance the abnormal brain deposition of metal ions and further dysregulate their homeostasis.

Formation of these side-products could diminish the final accumulation of Reb D and Reb M in the production strain (Fig. 1).

Other C metabolism enzymes that were downregulated include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Cre01.g010900), which has been recently implicated in lipid accumulation in Arabidopsis  and the periplasmic carbonic anhydrase 1 (CAH1), which exhibited a dramatic drop in abundance from a maximum level of ~1500 to 0 FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). The overall repression of C fixation is an indication of transition into a lowered metabolic state as a consequence of the cessation of growth.

Subsequently, the study aims to correlate optical, thermal and electrochemical modifications with treatment parameters such as blasting pressure, nozzle distance and number of passes. After the treatment, the target surface has enhanced spectral, thermal and electrochemical properties because of the graphene’s turbostratic nature to adhesion to its surface. The thermal stability performance showed a consistent 5% increase relative to a bare aluminum substrate. A two-fold increase in corrosion resistance is seen in the sample compared to bare aluminum while diffuse absorbance values enhancement is around three-fold. This proposed manufacturing method provides straightforward and effective treatment at various degrees of automation. Since the deposited graphene substrate can cover a large area, it can be applied as a final layer on thermal collectors, PV panels and for other applications. It is possible to adopt this process to other well-established treatment plants without requiring high investments in the overhead expenses.",

By exploiting the biodegradability of magnesium alloys, the prospects of developing an unprecedented class of implant are at hand. To do so however, the rate of corrosion of the alloys must be modified in order to better suit physiological conditions. Therefore, anodization was carried out on AZ31B and AZ91E specimens to alter the surface chemistry to reduce the corrosion rates and improve biocompatibility. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and contact angle meter, were used to characterize and compare the surfaces of untreated and anodized magnesium alloys. Corrosion behavior was evaluated by electrochemical tests using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, to verify changes in corrosion rates as a result of anodization. Finally, a bio-assessment using MTS assays and fluorescent microscopy were carried out to ensure that the anodization process had no compromise on the biocompatibility of the magnesium alloys.

The blue curves in Fig. 3e, f present extinction spectra of doped PBTTT nanoantennas with 90 nm thickness and around 400 nm diameter, showing a plasmonic resonance peak of around 2100 nm. Upon acetonitrile or temperature de-doping, the resonance peak almost disappears due to the lowered doping levels (red and green curves). Additionally, de-doping led to the emergence of the absorption signature around 590 nm of the de-doped PBTTT polymer. Upon re-doping the PBTTT nanodisks, the plasmonic resonance peak recovered to its original state, as shown in the dashed blue curves. Importantly, for both the acetonitrile and temperature annealing de-doping processes, the nanooptical response of the nanodisks could be repeatedly modulated over multiple cycles (see Supplementary Figs. 13, 14).",

In addition, CeO2-containing materials are often used in oxide fuel cells8, precision polishing materials9,10, UV filters10, corrosion prevention11, and other applications1,12,13.This widespread use of Ce is partially due to its significant abundance (0.0046% by weight of the Earth’s crust) and its Ce3+/Ce4+ redox couple, which is crucial to many applications by facilitating the formation of CeO2−x, containing highly reactive defect sites comprising O vacancies and attendant Ce3+ ions1,12,14. Ceria can thus act as an efficient oxygen buffer, assisted by oxygen mobility within its layered fluorite structure. In fact, bulk ceria naturally contains relatively few Ce3+/O-vacancy defect sites at ambient temperatures, but their number increases at higher temperatures where Ce4+ reduction and oxygen release are favoured.

In combination with PTT and CDT, AMP showed excellent in vitro and in vivo tumor suppressive effects. Compared to Fe-based catalysts, Cu-based Fenton-like reaction catalysts do not require excessively low pH conditions and have much higher catalytic activity than Fe-based catalysts, such as, Cu+ catalyzed H2O2 decomposition at 160 times the reaction rate of Fe2+ catalysts. Therefore, the use of Cu-based MOF materials to trigger CDT is expected to further improve therapeutic efficiency. Lin groups used Cu2+ and the tetracarboxyphenylporphyrin (H4TBP) to construct the nano-MOF material Cu-TBP for CDT, PDT and immuno-trimodal therapy of tumors .

The BmoR with isobutanol binding would activate Eσ54 closed complex and then induce the transcription initiation of promoter Pbmo. The whole response process was shown in Fig. 1. Firstly, we constructed a GFP-based BmoR-Pbmo biosensor system and testified its effectiveness. Then, this biosensor system combining with isobutanol biosynthetic pathway was introduced into the mutagenesis library to screen the isobutanol overproducers. As a result, the mutant which was screened out from the mutagenesis library could produce 14.0 ± 1.0 g/L isobutanol in shake flask and 56.5 ± 1.8 g/L isobutanol in a 3-L bioreactor. This work illustrated that BmoR-based biosensor could respond to intracellular isobutanol and could be used to screen isobutanol overproducers, which has the potential to be engineered to overproduce l-valine since the biosynthesis pathways of isobutanol and l-valine shared the same precursor 2-KIV.",

For example, splitPFAS has specific SMARTS corresponding to the 4 PFAS categories specified, which likely explains why no splittable bonds could be detected in some cases. That said, it is important to bear in mind that splitPFAS was designed with a different intention than OngLai; splitPFAS is not dedicated to homologous series classification, therefore it cannot be directly compared.

Corynebacterium glutamicum is the major industrial workhorse for the production of l-lysine  and—unlike P. putida  and E. coli —it naturally misses catabolic reactions for degradation of l-lysine. l-lysine overproducing C. glutamicum strains are hence ideal metabolic chassis for establishing bio-based fermentation processes for these interesting compounds, as there are no side-reactions competing with the target product formation. In this work, we established a de novo production process for the carbon-5 platform chemicals 5-aminovalerate and glutarate on basis of C. glutamicum LYS-12 .

In the aqueous environment used here, the hydrolysis of the ester MDP into its carboxylic acid and methanol is rather slow (Supplementary Results Section 1.3 and Supplementary Fig. 5); thus, such an MPD hydrolysis should not significantly impact our experiments. When we add one of those two EDU-mimetics, i.e., urea or MDP, to the same Fmoc-AVD sample tested before, we obtain the following results: Whereas even high concentrations of urea (i.e., 3000 mM) do not affect the gelation process of Fmoc-AVD at all, the presence of MDP prevents gelation (Fig. 4b).",

The density functional theory (DFT) geometry optimization of + complexes verifies the preference of the C=O group of Ace and both two O atoms of TFSI− for the coordination with the central Zn2+ cation (Supplementary Figs. 9, 11). The + structure with bidentate coordination by TFSI− possesses the most uniform molecular electrostatic potential energy surface distribution along with relatively low total binding energy (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Figs. 9, 11, 12), in reasonable agreement with the predominant signal of cationic species observed from HRMS. Note that the steric-hindrance effect caused by the bulky TFSI− also dictates the identity of solution species.

FPD-HZN-Dex can self-assemble into the nanoparticles with the core–shell architecture in aqueous media as potential carriers for anticancer drugs. Covalent attachment of perfluoroalkyl chains to the surface of peptide dendrons with unique and adjustable physiochemical properties. The tendency of FPD to separate and assemble into a fluorous phase that is both hydrophobic and lipophobic, which is attributed to the efficient amphiphilic functionalization of hydrophilic dextran by the hydrophobic FPD. Moreover, the FPD-HZN-Dex self-assembled systems based on acid-sensitive hydrazone linkage also can serve as stimulus bioresponsive carriers for on-demand intracellular drug delivery. In order to develop a stimulus responsive multifunctional delivery system, studies on the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy, as well as noninvasive imaging of FPD-HZN-Dex nanoparticles are in progress, further works will be focused on the exact mechanism of fluorination on drug delivery.

        "input": "Periodically ordered arrays of vertically aligned Si nanowires (Si NWs) are successfully fabricated by nanosphere lithography combined with metal-assisted chemical etching. By adjusting the etching time, both the nanowires’ diameter and length can be well controlled. The conductive properties of such Si NWs and particularly their size dependence are investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) on individual nanowires. The results indicate that the conductance of Si NWs is greatly relevant to their diameter and length. Si NWs with smaller diameters and shorter lengths exhibit better conductive properties. Together with the I–V curve characterization, a possible mechanism is supposed with the viewpoint of size-dependent Schottky barrier height, which is further verified by the electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurements. This study also suggests that CAFM can act as an effective means to explore the size (or other parameters) dependence of conductive properties on individual nanostructures, which should be essential for both fabrication optimization and potential applications of nanostructures.",

In this work, we exploit such shape change for the benefit of static electrodes through the electrodeposition of hyper-dendritic nanoporous zinc foam. Electrodeposition of zinc foam resulted in nanoparticles formed on secondary dendrites in a three-dimensional network with a particle size distribution of 54.1–96.0 nm. The nanoporous zinc foam contributed to highly oriented crystals, high surface area and more rapid kinetics in contrast to conventional zinc in alkaline mediums. The anode material presented had a utilization of ~88% at full depth-of-discharge (DOD) at various rates indicating a superb rate capability. The rechargeability of Zn0/Zn2+ showed significant capacity retention over 100 cycles at a 40% DOD to ensure that the dendritic core structure was imperforated.

The coherence length of fibrils in ref3-2 is also significantly smaller than wild type, again indicative of significant disruption of the order typical of vasculature in wild type plants. The lower cellulose fiber content in ccr may be due to different interactions between cellulose and the ferulic acid-containing lignin that is abundant in ccr during deposition of cellulose.

Nevertheless, their titers, yields, and productivities are insufficient for industrial application. The main reason is that most of the xylose assimilated by these strains is diverted to ethanol production. Thus, future work to remove or control ethanol biosynthesis will be key in developing industrially relevant strains to produce BCHAs from xylose. Deletion of the three pyruvate decarboxylase genes (PDC1, PDC5, and PDC6), which divert metabolic flux away from BCHAs and toward ethanol, results in strains that are notably difficult to work with because they lose the ability to grow on high glucose concentrations . This complication may be avoided when cells grow on xylose instead of glucose, given that yeast does not recognize xylose as a fermentable carbon source . If this is not the case, however, the timing and levels of PDC1 expression may be controlled, for example optogenetically , in a xylose-utilizing strain, which would significantly improve BCHA production from xylose.",

        "input": "BackgroundSesquiterpenes are a class of natural products with a diverse range of attractive industrial proprieties. Due to economic difficulties of sesquiterpene production via extraction from plants or chemical synthesis there is interest in developing alternative and cost efficient bioprocesses. The hydrocarbon α-santalene is a precursor of sesquiterpenes with relevant commercial applications. Here, we construct an efficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell factory for α-santalene production.ResultsA multistep metabolic engineering strategy targeted to increase precursor and cofactor supply was employed to manipulate the yeast metabolic network in order to redirect carbon toward the desired product. To do so, genetic modifications were introduced acting to optimize the farnesyl diphosphate branch point, modulate the mevalonate pathway, modify the ammonium assimilation pathway and enhance the activity of a transcriptional activator. The approach employed resulted in an overall α-santalene yield of a 0.0052 Cmmol (Cmmol glucose)-1 corresponding to a 4-fold improvement over the reference strain. This strategy, combined with a specifically developed continuous fermentation process, led to a final α-santalene productivity of 0.036 Cmmol (g biomass)-1 h-1.ConclusionsThe results reported in this work illustrate how the combination of a metabolic engineering strategy with fermentation technology optimization can be used to obtain significant amounts of the high-value sesquiterpene α-santalene. This represents a starting point toward the construction of a yeast “sesquiterpene factory” and for the development of an economically viable bio-based process that has the potential to replace the current production methods.",

The removal rate of this novel fluid is extremely low compared with the value of conventional one even though the spot of the former is much bigger. This surprising phenomenon is generated due to the small size and low saturation magnetization (Ms) of Fe3O4 and corresponding weak shear stress under external magnetic field according to material removal rate model of magnetorheological finishing (MRF). Different from conventional D-shaped finishing spot, the low Ms also results in a shuttle-like spot because the magnetic controllability is weak and particles in the fringe of spot are loose.

However, when graphene was placed on a silicon-on-insulator, double-side fluorination of the graphene occurred due to the etching of silicon by XeF2. The resultant perfluorinated graphene demonstrated a structure of two F atoms per one unit cell, forming an empirical structure of perfluorographane (CF). A similar double-sided structure was also reported by Nair et al.85 in 2010, in which they exposed graphene supported by an Au grid to a XeF2 atmosphere.

The cells were observed using an inverted multiphoton microscope (Nikon, A1 MP+ with Ti2 E). The multiphoton fluorescence signals from PSMA-242 (Fig. 4d) and PSMA-YI-1 NPs (Fig. 4e) were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, demonstrating that the nanoparticles were biocompatible and able to enter cells through endocytosis. To demonstrate in vivo deep-tissue imaging, we tail-vein injected the PSMA-242 and PSMA-YI-1 NPs to circulate them in the blood of mice and successfully observed their presence in the blood vessels of mouse ears (Fig. 4f and g). These NPs were able to circulate to the ear (white arrows) after tail-vein injection (see Additional file 2: Movie S1 and Additional file 3: Movie S2). These features validated that dye-loaded PSMA NPs can serve as NIR-active multiphoton contrast agents in deep-tissue biomedical imaging.",

        "input": "With the rapid rise in global population over the past decades, there has been a corresponding surge in demand for resources such as food and energy. As a consequence, the rate of waste generation and resultant pollution levels have risen drastically. Currently, most organic solid wastes are either land applied or sent to landfills, with the remaining fraction incinerated or anaerobically digested. However, with the current emphasis on the reduction of emissions, nutrient recovery, clean energy production and circular economy, it is important to revisit some of the conventional methods of treating these wastes and tap into their largely unrealized potential in terms of environmental and economic benefits. Wastewater sludge, with its high organic content and fairly constant supply, provides a great opportunity to implement some of these strategies using thermochemical conversion technologies, which are considered as one of the alternatives for upcycling such waste streams. This paper summarizes the results of prominent studies for valorizing wastewater sludge through thermochemical conversion technologies while drawing inferences and identifying relationships between different technical and operating parameters involved. This is followed by sections emphasizing the environmental and economic implications of these technologies, and their corresponding products in context of the broader fields of waste-to-energy, nutrient recycling and the progress towards a circular economy.",

The extended Stone–Wales line defects introduces occupied and empty bands in the fundamental band gap of pristine h-BN which effectively reduces the band gap for proximate point defects. As a consequence, the ionization energies of these point defects are reduced that can affect their photo-stability as found for divacancy defects inside stacking faults in 4H SiC35. Moreover, some common defects in h-BN, like carbon substitutional defects28, have optical transition between the in-gap defect level and band edges. Since the effective band edges shift closer to the in-gap defect level for defects near the Stone–Wales line defect the corresponding optical signal will change with showing generally longer wavelength emission. Stone–Wales line defects also generate a strain field that can act on the optical transition of point defects, in which the optical transition occurs between in-gap defects states but sensitive to the strain field, e.g., vacancy complexes36.",

In the stationary growth phase, no additional naringenin production was observed, though p-coumaric acid accumulation started. This could indicate insufficient malonyl-CoA formation, which blocks the pathway upstream of p-coumaric acid. However, platings on LB-agar of the first fermentation samples showed a yellow coloration of the agar, the color of naringenin chalcone, while for further platings this effect diminished, and microscopic images of these samples showed filamentation of the cells, which is a sign of stress  (see Additional file 1: Fig. S11). Following these observations, the production plasmid of two, non-coloring, single colonies was analyzed by sequencing, showing different large deletions in the pathway genes, which obviously contributes to production termination.

        "input": "Rhizome of Polygonatum sibiricum is both a renowned traditional Chinese remedy and a commonly consumed delicacy. Due to the escalating demand and excessive overexploitation, there has been a growing interest in the artificial cultivation of this plant in recent years. To assess the therapeutic benefits of artificially cultivated P. sibiricum, it is crucial to identify and classify its phytochemical components, which are the primary bioactive compounds found in its rhizome. In this study, the phytochemical profile of an artificially cultivated P. sibiricum rhizomes with multiple rhizome buds (ACM) was characterized by using untargeted UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS based approach. In addition, two-wild-types P. sibiricum rhizomes, namely the wild-type with multiple rhizome buds (WTM) and the wild-type with single rhizome bud (WTS), were used for comparison. A total of 183 phytochemicals, including 20 alkaloids, 48 flavonoids, 33 phenolic acids, and 82 terpenoids, were tentatively identified. Generally, the phytochemical profile of ACM was comparable to that of WTM and WTS. In specific, most of the identified alkaloids and phenolic acids, and approximately half of the identified terpenoids, were not significantly different. Notably, several phytochemicals with potent therapeutic properties, such as epiberberine, laetanine, sinapic acid, curcumenol, were present in ACM. Additionally, artificial cultivation increased the abundance of geniposide and naringenin, which have been linked to cardioprotective effects. These findings provide valuable insights for the future utilization of artificially cultivated P. sibiricum.",

This method complements modern research on dynamic combinatorial covalent libraries of disulfides19,23 by providing a method to isolate and kinetically capture individual members of such equilibrating systems; in addition, the key pnictogen additive during the self-assembly step avoids the formation of disulfide polymers that plagued early efforts aimed at synthesizing discrete polydisulfides39,47.",

Thus, by means of topochemistry, we “functionalize” the precursor and could theoretically obtain parent compounds for stoichiometric amounts of F (e.g. x = 1). In LaFeAs(O,F), on the contrary, the ternary LaFeAs precursor simply does not exist, and F merely substitutes O in LaFeAsO (i.e. an already known material).

A slight increase in the initial release of growth factor was observed from hydrogel mixture with the higher concentration of HA; however, no significant difference was observed in release of the growth factor from the two tested scaffolds for up to two weeks (p value > 0.05). Moreover, immunofluorescent staining with the anti-TGF-β1 antibody showed less retained TGF-β1 in alginate/HA hydrogels than alginate hydrogel without HA after 14 days (Figs. 2f and 2g).",

We recently reported NaSn2As2 as a novel vdW-type superconductor with transition temperature (Tc) of 1.3 K. Herein, we present the crystal structure and superconductivity of new material Na1−xSn2P2 with Tc = 2.0 K. Its crystal structure consists of two layers of a buckled honeycomb network of SnP, bound by the vdW forces and separated by Na ions, as similar to that of NaSn2As2. Amount of Na deficiency (x) was estimated to be 0.074(18) using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Bulk nature of superconductivity was confirmed by the measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. First-principles calculation using density functional theory shows that Na1−xSn2P2 and NaSn2As2 have comparable electronic structure, suggesting higher Tc of Na1−xSn2P2 resulted from increased density of states at the Fermi level due to Na deficiency. Because there are various structural analogues with tin-pnictide (SnPn) conducting layers, our results indicate that SnPn-based layered compounds can be categorized into a novel family of vdW-type superconductors, providing a new platform for studies on physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.",

        "input": "The dominant loss of atmospheric CH4 has been consistently reported to be its chemical reactions with atmospheric oxidants (OH and Cl)4,5. Yet, previous CH4 modeling studies mostly use lower-boundary conditions of CH4, i.e., resetting the surface CH4 mixing ratios at each time step to its predefined latitude-dependent values, which largely neglects the chemical processing of atmospheric CH4. Our study, on the other hand, applies direct CH4 emissions from spatially-resolved inventories of anthropogenic and natural sources, which facilitates a more realistic representation of atmospheric CH4 abundances via its chemical processing and climate feedbacks (Fig. 2). Specifically, changes in atmospheric oxidants due to RHS interact with atmospheric CH4 in a globally consistent manner, allowing a complete chemistry-climate coupling. We recommend that future climate simulations should apply emission inventories for CH4 and other short-lived climate forcers to fully represent their complex and non-linear connections with the components of the climate system.",

It was mainly suggested the use of the coacervate route for glass preparation as a promising method for coating and joining processes. The coacervate route for glass formation has the advantage of allowing control of the glasses properties through coacervate formulation, since different metallic ions and counter-ions can be used, such as chloride, sulfide and nitride, besides the possibility of mixing different coacervates before melting. Additionaly, the glass formation through coacervate route occurs at room temperature, leading to a low-cost synthesis route, avoiding unnecessary energy consumption in comparison with the melt-quenching method. On the other hand, little is known about the structural differences between the conventional polyphosphate glasses (those obtained from the melt-quenching process of the precursors salts) and the polyphosphate glasses obtained via the coacervate route.",

The distance and orientation dependence of energy migration have not been experimentally investigated in detail. Here we propose a method to investigate energy migration. Two fluorophores are introduced into one strand of a DNA duplex with a quencher placed opposite one of fluorophores. This design enables asymmetrization of identical fluorophores and allows one fluorophore to behave as an acceptor. The emission intensities and lifetimes decrease depending on the efficiency of energy migration. Distance and orientation dependence are successfully quantified, and the excitation energy migration efficiencies measured are in excellent agreement with those calculated based on Förster theory. We also demonstrate that multi-step energy migration among four fluorophores can be estimated from the theory. These results may provide a basis for design and preparation of efficient light-harvesting photonic devices and chemical probes.",

Typically, pretreatment of lignocellulosic feedstocks involves first synthesizing the IL in an independent reaction, then adding the solvent to biomass. However, we have recently invented a novel one-pot deconstruction process that takes advantage of the organic acids released during ensiling to remove this unit operation entirely . This “in-situ” IL synthesis process simplifies the procedure, potentially reducing operation and supply costs.

The magnitude of the irreversible component of the Dirac point shift in Gr-FETs (~30 mV) was considerably smaller than that in GM-FETs (~90 mV), whereas the remaining reversible component was similar for both FETs (~7.0 mV/pH). This reflects the fact that both intrinsic and extrinsic defects provided interaction sites for H+ ions, whereas the increased number of defects at the mesh edges enhanced the pH response of the GM-FETs during the initial cycles. Furthermore, the irreversible response is believed to be caused by the direct adsorption of ions onto defects, which presumably involved strong chemisorption. It has been reported that H+ ions were attached so strongly to the edge defects and have only been detached after high temperature annealing . Such strong interactions were rarely reversed, and thus led to passivation of the defects upon repeated exposure to acidic solutions.

Thus, most identified degrader lineages have several genes coding for GH and many seemingly redundant enzymes targeting similar substrates . Across environments, polysaccharides are associated and form complex structures (e.g., plant cell walls); therefore, many degraders often target several substrates (e.g., cellulose and xylan) . To degrade complex polysaccharides, bacteria have adopted several strategies including the production of (i) individual enzymes, sometimes associated with non-catalytic accessory domains, such as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) ; (ii) production of complex proteins with multiple GH domains (i.e., multi-activity GH, MAGH), with or without CBM ; and (iii) the production of non-covalent multi-protein complexes called cellulosomes . When released simultaneously, distinct GH domains act synergistically and display overall improved hydrolytic activity, compared to single domains. Synergy among GH domains is further achieved by the physical association of catalytic domains into complex proteins with multiple catalytic domains, and in cellulosomes . These MAGHs and protein complexes are promising tools for improving biomass processing .",

A non-proteinogenic amino acid, 4-amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (4,3-AHBA), retains ortho-aminophenol and carboxylic acid groups in its molecular structure; therefore, it is expected to be a precursor for polybenzoxazole (PBO), a class of highly functional materials with excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength formed by a ring-closing condensation reaction of these two functional groups . Recent studies demonstrated that 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA), a structural isomer of 4,3-AHBA, can be biosynthesized from biomass-derived carbon sources using recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum, possessing two-step enzymatic reactions originally identified in Streptomyces griseus , and can be used as a precursor for poly(2,5-benzoxazole-co-2,5-benzimidazole) plastic films .

However, their addition will increase water uptake and may compromise the mechanical integrity. Two experimental silicones (S1 and S2) differing only in the surface treatment of the filler, were investigated. Ultimate tensile strength (UTS), % elongation at break (Eb), Shore A hardness and, when doped with 1% CHD, water uptake and CHD release were measured. Elastic modulus (E) was calculated from the hardness measurements. There was no significant difference in UTS and Eb between the two materials. However S1 had a higher hardness (30.6 ± 0.97) and thus E (0.76 MPa) than S2 (hardness = 23.8 ± 0.48, E = 0.45 MPa). Water uptake for S2 (0.6%) was higher than for S2 (0.1) and addition of CHD dramatically increased the uptake of both (S1 = 3.1%, S2 = 4.0%). Release of CHD was higher for S2 (30%) than S1 (27%). Equating osmotic pressure within the droplets with elastic restraining force gave an extension ratio of 1.95 for S1 and 5.39 for S2.

To establish the effect of solids separation and/or washing, high solids loading enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed at varying enzyme loadings using optimized combinations of Cellic® CTec3, Cellic® HTec3 and Pectinex Ultra-SP. Further, the fermentability of all carbohydrate fractions from both AFEX™ and StEx were evaluated to determine the extent of microbial inhibition due to AFEX™- and StEx-pretreatment-derived inhibitors. From carbohydrate and ethanol mass balances, the potential ethanol yields per unit land for sugarcane biorefineries based on either AFEX™ or StEx for 2G ethanol production were estimated.

This phase segregated behavior explains the reduction in mobility and slower turn-on response observed in mixed diF-TES ADT TFTs, with grain boundaries between crystallites potentially introducing defects and reducing the efficiency of charge transfer in spite of their high crystallinity. The ability to spectrally discriminate isomer crystallites and their heterogeneous distribution and packing is important to optimize thin-film preparation in this small-molecule semiconductor, and can also provide information about isomer microstructure in other small molecules.

Pre-treatment of bacterial cells with Triton X-100 resulted in new features on the SERS spectra, allowing for a successful discrimination of common disease related bacteria including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Listeria and MRSA. We also demonstrate that the spectral features obtained using in situ synthesis of nanoparticles could be could be used to differentiate two species of listeria. By using L.innocua as a model sample, we found the limit of detection of our assay to be 103 CFU/mL.

The SYBYL line notation (SLN)  is suitable for representing reactions and reaction queries and provides a richer syntax for database queries comparable to SMARTS.

Different vessel types have been selected for analysis, including aryballoi, kotylai, olpai, anforiskoi, oinochoai, and alabastra, belonging to the “Proto-Corinthian and Corinthian” ware classes. The items, dating back to the period comprised between the early eighth and the first half of the sixth century BC, come from two different archaeological sites in the province of Messina (Sicily), specifically the Istmo necropolis of Milazzo, in the northern Sicilian coast, and the acropolis and necropolis of Lipari, in the Aeolian islands. The chemical characterization of ceramics, carried out through portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF), aimed at gaining information on the production area of examined items whose autoptic analysis pointed to Corinthian imports. The possibility of carrying out experimental investigations on the most ancient materials from the archaic necropolis of Milazzo and on fragments from Lipari, albeit limited to pXRF investigations, allowed to enrich the knowledge on the Corinthian production exported to western areas as well as to discriminate, no longer based solely on autoptic observations and stylistic evaluations, between Corinthian productions and \"local\" imitations.",

Several pathways to mitigate the capacity fading of silicon has been proposed, including optimization of the electrode composition. Within the present work we evaluated different binder formulations to improve the long-term performance of the Li-ion batteries’ anodes based on industrial grade silicon (Si) which is typically characterized by a particle sizes ranging from 100 nm to 5.5 microns. The decrease of pH in a binder formulation was found to detrimental for the cycling performance of Si due to enhanced formation of an ester-type bonding between the carboxylic group of the binder and hydroxyl group on the Si surface as well as cross-linking. Furthermore, the present work was focused on the use of the industrial grade Si with very high loading of Si material (up to 80% by weight) to better highlight the effects of the surface chemistry of Si and its influence on the performance of Si-based anodes in Li-ion batteries. The tested system allowed to establish a pseudo self-healing effect that manifests itself through the restoration of the anode capacity by approximately 25% and initiates after approximately 20 cycles. The stabilization of the capacity is attributed to self-limiting lithiation process. Such effect is closely related to SEI formation and transport properties of an electrode prepared from silicon of industrial grade.",

Besides, in comparison with IAM1183-CD, the production of H2 decreased by 7.2% of IAM1183-CD/R, and the strain IAM1183-CDE/R had a slight decrease on H2 production compared with IAM1183-CDE (Table 3). RyhB suppresses the expression of at least 44 genes under anaerobic conditions, including Fe-binding proteins and factors involved in the TCA cycle, and this fact may explain these differences in H2 production . These unusual results may be due to a blockade of the ethanol biosynthesis pathway under anaerobic conditions, in which NADH is consumed more rapidly compared with other NADH-consuming pathways.",

Although many studies have focused on the role of surface morphology of the hairs, very little is known about the role of surface chemistry on wetting and adhesion. We expect that both surface chemistry and morphology are important, not only to achieve optimum dry adhesion but also for increased efficiency in self-cleaning of water and adhesion under wet conditions. Here, we used a plasma-based vapor deposition process to coat the hairy patterns on gecko toe pad sheds with polar and non-polar coatings without significantly perturbing the setal morphology. By a comparison of wetting across treatments, we show that the intrinsic surface of gecko setae has a water contact angle between 70–90°. As expected, under wet conditions, adhesion on a hydrophilic surface (glass) was lower than that on a hydrophobic surface (alkyl-silane monolayer on glass). Surprisingly under wet and dry conditions the adhesion was comparable on the hydrophobic surface, independent of the surface chemistry of the setal hairs. This work highlights the need to utilize morphology and surface chemistry in developing successful synthetic adhesives with desirable adhesion and self-cleaning properties.",

However, the relationship between atomic dynamics resulting in liquid-like diffusion and anomalous phonon transport properties remains poorly understood. Herein, combing ab initio molecular dynamics with temperature-dependent Raman measurements, we have performed a thorough investigation on the lattice dynamics of Cu3SbSe3. Superionic transition is unveiled for both structurally inequivalent Cu atoms at elevated temperatures, while the Se-formed tetrahedral framework can simultaneously maintain. An intermediate state of Cu3SbSe3 through the mixture of quasi-1D/2D Cu nearest-neighbor vacancy hopping is discovered below the superionic transition temperature. Our results also manifest that phonons predominately involved with Cu contributions along diffusion channels have been strongly scattered during the superionic transition, whereas the liquid-like diffusion of Cu is too slow to completely breakdown the propagation of all transverse phonon modes. The insight provided by this work into the atomic dynamics and phonon scattering relationship may pave the way for further phonon engineering of Cu3SbSe3 and related superionic materials.",

Through a set of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the effects of surface charge on the oil contact angles in an ideal water-decane-silicon dioxide system. The results show that the contact angles of oil nano-droplets have a great dependence on the surface charges. As the surface charge density exceeds a critical value of 0.992 e/nm2, the contact angle reaches up to 78.8° and the water-wet state is very apparent. The variation of contact angles can be confirmed from the number density distributions of oil molecules. With increasing the surface charge density, the adsorption of oil molecules weakens and the contact areas between nano-droplets and silicon dioxide surface are reduced. In addition, the number density distributions, RDF distributions, and molecular orientations indicate that the oil molecules are adsorbed on the silicon dioxide surface layer-by-layer with an orientation parallel to the surface. However, the layered structure of oil molecules near the silicon dioxide surface becomes more and more obscure at higher surface charge densities.",

The metal barrier layers are deposited through PVD, such as Ta and Ti. This approach has the benefits of low temperature during process but suffers poor step coverage easily for high aspect ratio TSV (>10:1) .

In particular, pH changes can indicate different metabolic compounds produced and drastically alter the cell phenotype, potentially affecting further growth or perturbing extracellular reactions. Usually pH and oxygen concentration are thoroughly monitored and controlled during standard culturing. Stirring and aeration are used to control oxygen availability, while buffers and feedback loops are widely applied to adjust pH during cultivation in automated bioreactors. However, monitoring and controlling these variables is more complex at small scales.

By definition, the quantity of reducing sugars produced upon the addition of xylanase with cellulase is associated with a larger DS. Large quantities of reducing sugars were produced by the addition of xylanase to cellulase. The DS values of the mutant cooperative treatment group were 1.9, 1.4, and 1.6, at 2, 3, and 1 h, respectively, which were the highest values achieved and 27%, 27%, and 14% higher than those of the WT cooperative treatment group, respectively. These results indicate that the xylanase mutants promoted cellulase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the three types of biomass, and the mutants could be arranged as M53S/F54L/N207G > XYL10C_∆N in decreasing order of strength. Previous studies have reported that xylanase can significantly promote cellulase degradation in bagasse. During alkaline pretreatment in bagasse hydrolysis, endoxylanase Xyn11A and endoglucanase Cel7B exhibited a strong synergistic effect (DS: 6.3), which significantly increased sugar production .

The data available in the literature on the effect of grain size on corrosion resistance were reviewed by Ralston et al.54. It was found for various materials that grain refinement generally leads to increased corrosion resistance. This is mainly attributed to an improved formation of the passivation film and adhesion as a result of the higher grain boundary density. Nevertheless, direct evidence is still lacking in the literature.

The first change is that absorption of -COOH at 3150 cm−1 is significantly reduced. At the same time, new C-O-C absorption occurs and it overlaps with previous C-O-C absorption, resulting in extensive C-O-C absorption. Secondly, absorption of C=O moves from 1740 cm−1 to low wavenumber direction (1720 cm−1). This is due to the increase of the conjugate system. The third major change is the appearance of a new C=C in-plane absorption peak at 1562 cm−1. This is because that photo-reduction process of GO can induce deoxygenation and restore the sp2 domain . Finally, a further enhancement of C-H absorption is observed since more H atoms combine with C atoms.",

Sphaerimicins are naturally occurring macrocyclic nucleoside inhibitors of MraY and are considered a promising target in antibacterial discovery. However, developing sphaerimicins as antibacterials has been challenging due to their complex macrocyclic structures. In this study, we construct their characteristic macrocyclic skeleton via two key reactions. Having then determined the structure of a sphaerimicin analogue bound to MraY, we use a structure-guided approach to design simplified sphaerimicin analogues. These analogues retain potency against MraY and exhibit potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including clinically isolated drug resistant strains of S. aureus and E. faecium.

        "input": "We have shown that the application of mechanical stress can change the binding energy of adsorbates at surface steps of LTMs in an unexpected way—tensile stresses can decrease binding energy and compressive stresses increase binding energy—the opposite of established trends on close-packed surfaces. The new trend is controlled by mechanical interaction energies rather than electronic interaction energies, and is rationalized through a mechanics analysis of the interaction between the adsorbate-induced strains and the applied stress. Most importantly, the existence of this new trend indicates that application of mechanical stress provides new avenues to increase overall catalytic activity for many processes in which the controlling reactions occur at steps. We have demonstrated the impact of this general strategy by showing that methanation on strained Ni is predicted to reach the peak activity of the volcano plot. In total, the results here demonstrate a new scientific phenomenon, the intimate interaction between chemistry and mechanics and the importance of the new phenomenon for enhancing catalytic activity in industrial processes.",

Cell adhesion and spread area were enhanced as the duration of pre-aging PDLLA films in cell culture medium was increased. Materials characterization showed that the hydrophobicity and surface morphology of the PDLLA films changed with increasing length of pre-aging time. These results suggest that cell adhesion and spreading are sensitive to the time-dependent changes in PDLLA hydrophobicity and surface morphology that occur during exposure of the polymer to cell medium for different lengths of time.

An ultraviolet (UV) or visible (VIS) light source is critical for SLA printing technology. UV light can be used to manufacture 3D objects in SLA-3DP, but there are significant occupational safety and health issues (particularly for eyes). These issues prevent the widespread use of SLA-3DP at home or in the office. Through the use of VIS light, the safety and health issues can largely be solved, but only non-transparent 3D objects can be manufactured, which prevents the application of 3DP to the production of various common transparent consumer products. For these reasons, we developed a VIS light-curable yet visibly transparent resin for SLA-3DP, which also retains UV curability. The key was to identify the photoinitiator diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (DPTBP). DPTBP was originally designed as a UV photoinitiator, but we found that VIS light irradiation is sufficient to split DPTBP and generate radicals due to its slight VIS light absorption up to 420 nm. The cured resin displays high transparency and beautiful transparent colors by incorporating various dyes; additionally, its mechanical properties are superior to those of commercial resins (Arario 410) and photoinitiators (Irgacure 2959).",

        "input": "BackgroundCellulose amorphogenesis, described as the non-hydrolytic “opening up” or disruption of a cellulosic substrate, is becoming increasingly recognized as one of the key steps in the enzymatic deconstruction of cellulosic biomass when used as a feedstock for fuels and chemicals production. Although this process is thought to play a major role in facilitating hydrolysis, the lack of quantitative techniques capable of accurately describing the molecular-level changes occurring in the substrate during amorphogenesis has hindered our understanding of this process.ResultsIn this work, techniques for measuring changes in cellulose accessibility are reviewed and a new quantitative assay method is described. Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) with specific affinities for crystalline (CBM2a) or amorphous (CBM44) cellulose were used to track specific changes in the surface morphology of cotton fibres during amorphogenesis. The extents of phosphoric acid-induced and Swollenin-induced changes to cellulose accessibility were successfully quantified using this technique.ConclusionsThe adsorption of substructure-specific CBMs can be used to accurately quantify the extent of changes to cellulose accessibility induced by non-hydrolytic disruptive proteins. The technique provided a quick, accurate and quantitative measure of the accessibility of cellulosic substrates. Expanding the range of CBMs used for adsorption studies to include those specific for such compounds as xylan or mannan should also allow for the accurate quantitative tracking of the accessibility of these and other polymers within the lignocellulosic biomass matrix.",

        "input": "The oxidation of chromium in air at 700 °C was investigated with a focus on point defect behavior and transport during oxide layer growth. A comprehensive set of characterization techniques targeted characteristics of chromium oxide microstructure and chemical composition analysis. TEM showed that the oxide was thicker with longer oxidation times and that, for the thicker oxides, voids formed at the metal/oxide interface. PAS revealed that the longer the oxidation time, there was an overall reduction in vacancy-type defects, though chromium monovacancies were not found in either case. EIS found that the longer oxidized material was more electrochemically stable and that, while all oxides displayed p-type character, the thicker oxide had an overall lower charge carrier density. Together, the results suggest anion oxygen interstitials and chromium vacancy cluster complexes drive transport in an oxidizing environment at this temperature, providing invaluable insight into the mechanisms that regulate corrosion.",

To screen for the biomasses from SacBAHD01 RNAi lines with improved digestibility, we decided on Organosolv pretreatment with ethanol as organic solvent, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis. We first established optimal enzymatic concentration to use on pretreated samples of wild-type plants by varying levels of a commercial mixture of cellulases and hemicellulases (Cellic® CTec 3; Novozymes), and demonstrating that 15 FPU/g was the minimum enzymatic activity necessary for the maximum glucose release after 48 h (Additional file 3: Figure S3). Next, we evaluated and optimized the effects of two pretreatment variables—the ethanol concentration (X1) and residence time (X2) on biomass enzymatic saccharification—using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on five-level Central Composite Design (CCD), originally described by Box and Wilson  and successfully used for optimizing processes . We used sugarcane leaves and stem tops of 12-month-old plants (straw) from transgenic lines that displayed the highest levels of SacBAHD01 suppression (events 1, 2.2, 2.4, 3.1, and 4) and nontransformed (NT) plants as biomass for Organosolv pretreatments.",

The compressive modulus of the scaffold was tailored to match the native spinal cord at 1.2 ± 0.2 MPa, along with controlled porosity. Rheological studies of the hydrogel showed excellent 3D shear-thinning printing capabilities and shape fidelity post-printing. In-vitro studies showed the scaffolds are cytocompatible and an in-vivo assessment in a rat SCI lesion model shows glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) upregulation not directly in contact with the lesion/implantation site, with diminished astrocyte reactivity. Decreased levels of macrophage and microglia reactivity at the implant site is also observed. This positively influences the re-establishment of signals and initiation of healing mechanisms. Observation of axon migration towards the scaffold can be attributed to immunomodulatory properties of HA in the scaffold caused by a controlled inflammatory response. HA limits astrocyte activation through its CD44 receptors and therefore limits scar formation. This allows for a superior axonal migration and growth towards the targeted implantation site through the provision of a stimulating microenvironment for regeneration.",

In previous reports, plasma surface modification has been proved to be a popular method to improve biocompatibility and hydrophilicity of biomaterials . Besides, plasma modification has been well-known as a versatile and effective method for modifying the surface properties or introducing desired chemical groups at the surface of PCL . Therefore, a plasma treatment step was employed to modify EsPCL’s surface in this investigation. To confirm if the plasma treatment changed the hydrophobicity of EsPCL membrane to hydrophilicity, water absorption, and MBS were employed. Both methods were observed on camera. Photographs showed that EsPCL membranes absorbed water and methylene blue solution. Thus, it can be concluded that EsPCL membranes became hydrophilicity after irradiating the plasma.",

        "input": "BackgroundFailure of colony PCRs in green microalga Chlorella vulgaris is typically attributed to the difficulty in disrupting its notoriously rigid cell walls for releasing the genetic materials and therefore the development of an effective colony PCR procedure in C. vulgaris presents a challenge.ResultsHere we identified that colony PCR results were significantly affected by the accumulated lipids rather than the rigid cell walls of C. vulgaris. The higher lipids accumulated in C. vulgaris negatively affects the effective amplification by DNA polymerase. Based on these findings, we established a simple and extremely effective colony PCR procedure in C. vulgaris. By simply pipetting/votexing the pellets of C. vulgaris in 10 ul of either TE (10 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA) or 0.2% SDS buffer at room temperature, followed by the addition of 10 ul of either hexane or Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol in the same PCR tube for extraction. The resulting aqueous phase was readily PCR-amplified as genomic DNA templates as demonstrated by successful amplification of the nuclear 18S rRNA and the chloroplast rbcL gene. This colony PCR protocol is effective and robust in C. vulgaris and also demonstrates its effectiveness in other Chlorella species.ConclusionsThe accumulated lipids rather than the rigid cell walls of C. vulgaris significantly impede the extraction of genetic materials and subsequently the effective colony PCRs. The finding has the potential to aid the isolation of high-quality total RNAs and mRNAs for transcriptomic studies in addition to the genomic DNA isolation in Chlorella.",

Here we have demonstrated the full potential of this approach with a Pt(111) curved crystal.

The curved sample allowed us to straightforwardly determine the hierarchy, and even the density of different adsorption sites with a single C 1s core-level z-image.

The mechanism behind this phenomenon could be attributed to the boronic acid groups which can interact with glycan units on the surface of virus and form tetravalent complexes selectively and reversibly. Hence, in this study boronic acid modified CQDs acted as pseudo lectins which conjugated to the envelope glycoprotein S of coronavirus, leading to the inactivation of virus. Further research showed that different modification modes resulted in different antiviral activities. For example, doping boron acid groups to CQDs could improve their antiviral activity against human coronavirus with an enhanced EC50 value of 5.2 ± 0.7 μgmL−1.",

For many years, magnetite iron ore mines, containing high-sulfur content (up to 2.0%), were not very welcomed in steel industry; however, they are nowadays increasingly receiving attention as potential sources and promising alternatives for iron ore resources. On the other hand, as the open pits mining grow deeper, magnetite iron ore is gradually being replaced by sulfur containing iron ore . In fact, the amount of the sulfur compounds on the top of mine is reduced as a result of the direct exposure to the air . It is known that the iron recovery by conventional method is not economically acceptable. Moreover, pretreatment of the sulfur containing iron ore will increase the processing costs. It is estimated that most of the magnetite iron ore will be consumed within a few years. Consequently, it will be crucial for the industry to adopt the offered innovative processing technologies.",

In this study, a semidominant mutant, Arabidopsis thaliana dwarf1 (Atdwa1), was discovered from activation tagging screening using the SKI015 TDNA vector. The Atdwa1 mutant displayed severe dwarfism and loss of apical dominance, as well as other pleiotropic defects, such as earlier flowering, fewer leaves, and shorter sliliques than those of the wild-type plant. Thermal asymmetric interlaced-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that activated T-DNA was inserted into the At5g54330 gene, disrupting its coding sequence. We also demonstrated that At5g54330 expression was nullified by the insertion, whereas expression of its downstream genes, At5g54340, At5g54350, and At5g54360, were activated. A database search revealed that all three downstream genes encode proteins related to C2H2-type zinc finger proteins. Overexpression of each gene resulted in dwarfism similar to that of Atdwa1. These findings indicate that Atdwa1 mutant was caused by synergistic manifestation of concomitant activation of At5g54340 to At5g54360, and that the zinc finger proteins may play a role in regulation of plant growth and development.",

        "input": "An economical and environmentally benign synthesis method remains important in industrial processes. In this work, kaolin an abundant and non-toxic precursor is employed for mesoporous gamma-alumina synthesis. The study explored the consequence of varying polyoxyethylene (40) stearate (PS) surfactant concentration and aging time in the synthesis of mesoporous gamma-alumina with enhancing structural properties. The alumina was characterized using X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric-Derivative Thermal Gravimetric (TG-DTG), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), N2 Adsorption–Desorption, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Solid State 27Al MAS NMR, and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Structural properties and morphology of the mesoporous γ-Al2O3 improved with increasing surfactant amount from 0.45 g to 1.8 g and aging time from 1 to 2 days, then dropped afterward. Accordingly, mesoporous γ-Al2O3 synthesized with 1.8 g PS and age for 2 days (Al-1.8-2) possessed the highest surface area of 319.2 m2/g, a narrow average pore diameter of 2.7 nm, and pore volume of 0.42 cm3/g. Thus, Al-1.8-2 was chosen and doped with 15% NaOH to obtained 15-Na/Al-1.8-2 catalyst. After modification, the basic sites increased, the surface area decreased, and the morphology changed, signifying Na incorporation into the alumina. On application in methanolysis reaction, up to 99.46% biodiesel yield was obtained, demonstrating a very high activity for the catalyst. The tremendous activity of the catalyst can be associated with the enhanced structural properties of the mesostructured gamma-alumina.",

        "input": "BackgroundCefprozil, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, was labeled with 99mTc. 99mTc-cefprozil was prepared by adding 99mTc to cefprozil in the presence of 50 µg SnCl2.dihydrite at pH 4 and 30-minutes reaction time. The radiochemical yield and purity of 99mTc-cefprozil were evaluated after species separation individually followed by subsequent quantification of the free and complexed species.Methods4 mg of cefprozil was accurately weighed and transferred to an evacuated penicillin vial. Exactly 50 µg SnCl2 solution was added and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 4 using 0.1N HCl, then the volume of the mixture was adjusted to one ml with N2-purged bidistilled water. One ml of freshly eluted 99mTcO4- (200- 400MBq) was added to the above mixture.ResultsThe obtained maximum radiochemical yield was found to be 97.5% ± 0.8%. The 99mTc-cefprozil complex was stable for 6 hrs. The biological distribution of 99mTc-cefprozil was experimentally investigated in induced-infection mice, in the left thigh, using Staphylococcus aureus.ConclusionsT/NT for 99mTc-cefprozil was found to be 5.5±0.12 at 2 hrs after intravenous injection, which was higher than that of the commercially available 99mTc-ciprofloxacin followed by gradual decline. The abscess to normal muscle ratio indicated that 99mTc-cefprozil could be used for infection imaging. Moreover, 99mTc-cefprozil could efficiently differentiate between bacterial infection and sterile inflammation.",

The enol-(S)-1 crystal exhibited a maximum displacement of 350 μm and maximum force of 3.5 mN at the steady-state under UV light. The value of the maximum force is comparable to similar salicylideneamine crystals and some azobenzene crystals28,38, and this suggests that the output force does not decrease as much, even though the PtPT consumes some energy. The elastic energy density and power density were also calculated to be 3 kJ m−3 and 2 kW m−3, respectively, based on the region of simple bending because twisted bending is difficult to consider in these calculations. These values are on the high side for photo-actuating molecular crystals28.

        "input": "BackgroundXylose isomerase (XI) catalyses the isomerisation of xylose to xylulose in bacteria and some fungi. Currently, only a limited number of XI genes have been functionally expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the microorganism of choice for lignocellulosic ethanol production. The objective of the present study was to search for novel XI genes in the vastly diverse microbial habitat present in soil. As the exploitation of microbial diversity is impaired by the ability to cultivate soil microorganisms under standard laboratory conditions, a metagenomic approach, consisting of total DNA extraction from a given environment followed by cloning of DNA into suitable vectors, was undertaken.ResultsA soil metagenomic library was constructed and two screening methods based on protein sequence similarity and enzyme activity were investigated to isolate novel XI encoding genes. These two screening approaches identified the xym1 and xym2 genes, respectively. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the genes shared 67% similarity and belonged to different bacterial groups. When xym1 and xym2 were overexpressed in a xylA-deficient Escherichia coli strain, similar growth rates to those in which the Piromyces XI gene was expressed were obtained. However, expression in S. cerevisiae resulted in only one-fourth the growth rate of that obtained for the strain expressing the Piromyces XI gene.ConclusionsFor the first time, the screening of a soil metagenomic library in E. coli resulted in the successful isolation of two active XIs. However, the discrepancy between XI enzyme performance in E. coli and S. cerevisiae suggests that future screening for XI activity from soil should be pursued directly using yeast as a host.",

        "input": "Introduction: Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) of solid tumors has a limited efficacy mainly because these tumours have high radioresistance and take up limited amounts of radiolabeled vectors. Strategies to overcome this include the use of small peptides combined with radionuclides that emit highly cytotoxic particles, namely high linear energy transfer (LET) particles such as alpha particles and Auger electrons. We have chosen to target the epithelial-specific integrin αvβ6, which is weak or absent on normal tissues but is upregulated on many cancers where it is strongly associated with reduced survival. One targeting vector is a 20 mer peptide, A20FMDV2 which we have previously used to image αvβ6-positive tumours with SPECT (In-111) or PET (F-18, Ga-68). The peptide showed extremely high kidney retention when radiolabelled with radiometals, but this was not seen with the F-18 analogue. Due to anticipated dose-limiting toxicity in kidney for radiometal-based TRT, we have developed a peptide suitable for radiohalogenation with the Auger electron emitter I-125 and the alpha particle emitter At-211.",

Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP)  and tail-gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP)  effectively reduce the oxygen content of bio-oils, such that the four aforementioned issues are at least partially mitigated. The thermally unstable oxygenated functional groups allow for standard distillation to proceed to three- to fourfold greater yields, in both batch  and continuous  modes. Distillation also allows for the generation of a coke residue coproduct for production of calcined coke . The reduction in oxygen also narrows the product distribution of bio-oils—with the major species being aromatic hydrocarbons and phenolics—thereby enabling a more meaningful separation to take place, based on extracting specific chemical species. Using a strong base, extraction can take place on the whole distillates , producing a hydrocarbon-only fraction and a phenolics fraction separately. While such a basic extraction process makes the refining into fuel hydrocarbons easier, improvements are needed to advance continuous isolation. Elucidating these extraction parameters will pave the way for continuous extraction of phenolic compounds. This paper establishes some principles in continuous extraction of phenol from bio-oils.",

Being an artificial polymer, its degradation rate can be tailored to suit its application. It can be easily moulded into structures with suitable mechanical strength and degrades into relatively harmless products in the body. Its adjustable degradation rate also makes it a potentially excellent controlled release delivery device. However, the functionalization of PLGA with bioactive molecules usually requires extensive chemical modification. Chemical modification may compromise the mechanical strength of PLGA and inactivate the bioactive molecules. In this paper, a study is done to investigate the coating of an angiogenic factor on unmodified PLGA suture substrates for the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) into endothelial cells (EC). The results show that the method used to anchor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) onto the PLGA surface can enable the gradual release of VEGF from the substrate into solution to induce the differentiation of hMSCs into ECs. Thus, this method can potentially be used to coat PLGA materials like sutures, meshes and scaffolds, rendering them functional as effective controlled release delivery devices for a wide range of bioactive molecules.",

In retrosynthesis analysis, the product representation forms the query to retrieve reactant molecules that are similar in high dimensional vector space. To conduct a fair comparison to other methods, the retrieved candidate reactants (denoted as “candidates” subsequently) are only derived from the same training and validation data set utilized by previous studies.",

Silicate dissolution exhibits complex temporal evolution and rich pattern formations. Recently, we showed how observed complexity could emerge from a simple self-organizational mechanism: dissolution of the silica framework in a material could be catalyzed by the cations released from the reaction itself. This mechanism enables us to systematically predict many key features of a silicate dissolution process including the occurrence of a sharp corrosion front (vs. a leached surface layer), oscillatory dissolution and multiple stages of the alteration process (e.g., an alteration rate resumption at a late stage of glass dissolution). Here, through a linear stability analysis, we show that the same mechanism can also lead to morphological instability of an alteration front, which, in combination with oscillatory dissolution, can potentially lead to a whole suite of patterning phenomena, as observed on archaeological glass samples as well as in laboratory experiments, including wavy dissolution fronts, growth rings, incoherent bandings of alteration products, and corrosion pitting. The result thus further demonstrates the importance of the proposed self-accelerating mechanism in silicate material degradation.",

        "input": "Bi-layered structures could be easily fabricated by crosslinking PEGDA gels on top of a preformed vascularization gel. The presence of free thiol groups on the surface of the first hydrogel layer allowed for a covalent crosslinking of the islet encapsulation layer on top of the vascularization layer. Such bi-layered hydrogels were mechanically stable and could be easily handled as a single construct. Similar results were achieved in the second approach where islets were modified with a conformal coating of bifunctional PEG, where the SVA group reacted with free amino groups exposed on the surface of the islets and the acryl group on the other extremity of the PEG chain was available for the reaction with acryl groups in the hydrogel matrix. Both approaches, schematically represented in Fig. 1, combine the favorable properties of non-adhesive and cell adhesive layers, and can be independently tuned on the specific cell type that will be embedded within the gel. In both cases it was possible to combine the dual layer approach in a single mechanically stable construct, in which the two layers were able to crosslink with each other by establishing covalent binding.",

When alkene is present in the system, peroxynitric acid immediately transfers oxygen to the C=C bond to form epoxy. Compared to cyclooxidation mediated by monooxygenases, chemoenzymatic epoxidation does not require cofactors and has a good organic solvent tolerance, allowing the use of non-haem-type peroxidases  or lipases . Because lipases have certain advantages in pricing and thermal stability, many successful examples of alkenes epoxidation have been reported, including the synthesis of aliphatic alkene, cyclene, and vinyl aromatic compounds . Although lipases have been isolated from various microbial genera, including Candida antarctica, Humicola sp., Pseudomonas sp., C. cylindracea, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus chinensis, R. oryzae, and Rhizomucor mieheii , the most widely used lipases are C. antarctica lipase B (CALB) .

        "input": "The formulations of drilling fluids using conventional clays are often faced with difficulties in the control of rheology, filtration and gelation, owing to the flocculation of the clay at the temperature above 250 °F. In this study, tannins were extracted from the bark wastes of Rhizophora Mucronata spp. (RMTE) and used as a deflocculant to formulate water-based muds (WBMs). The efficacy of reducing the gelation and viscosity of WBMs with the extracted RMTE was compared with commercial Modified Desco Tannin (MDT). The RMTE was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Rheological and filtration control properties tests were conducted on the RMTE and MDT mud samples before and after hot rolling tests at different temperatures of 225 °F, 250 °F, 275 °F and 300 °F. FTIR test data indicate the presence of different active functional groups in the RMTE structure, especially the hydroxyl (–OH) groups, which are responsible for the good thinning ability of the RMTE. Experimental data of the WBM after hot rolling tests with 8 g concentration at 300 °F show a 43.5% reduction of plastic viscosity with MDT and 50% reduction with RMTE. With a concentration of 2 g, the yield point of the WBM with commercial MDT and locally derived RMTE at 225 °F before hot rolling tests reduced by 50% and 57.1%, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of RMTE and MDT to the WBM reduced the filtrate volume and the gel strength. The experimental data indicate that the RMTE shows better deflocculating performance compared to that of the MDT, illustrating the need for its application in WBMs for high-temperature wells.",

From this analysis, we postulated a hypothesis that the HXK enzyme has negative control over specific xylose uptake rate and we performed an experiment to verify it. Although the effects of HXK2 deletions on glucose repression have been studied before , a deletion of HXK2 has not been studied as a means to improve xylose consumption in glucose–xylose co-fermenting S. cerevisiae strains.

Because the switching peptides (fluorescence-labeled) were able to bind the frame region of antibodies (IgGs), they were dissociated from antibodies immediately when target analytes were bound to the binding pockets of antibodies. From the fluorescence signal measurements of switching peptides, a quantitative analysis of target analytes, via a one-step immunoassay without any washing steps, could be performed. As the first step, the binding constant (KD) of OTA to the antibodies was estimated under the continuous flow conditions of a surface plasmon resonance biosensor. Then, the optimal switching peptide, among four types of switching peptides, and the reaction condition for complex formation with the switching peptide were determined for the one-step immunoassay for OTA analysis. Additionally, the selectivity test of one-step immunoassay for OTA was carried out in comparison with phenylalanine and zearalenone. For the application to the one-step immunoassay to detect OTA in wines, two types of sample pre-treatment methods were compared: (1) a liquid extraction was carried out using chloroform as a solvent with subsequent resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (total analysis time < 1 h); (2) direct dilution of the wine sample (total analysis time < 0.5 h). Finally, the direct dilution method was found to be effective for the one-step immunoassay based on the switching peptide assay for OTA in wines with a markedly improved total analysis time (< 0.5 h).

The amount of enzyme components in the supernatant decreased after lignin adsorption affected the enzymatic hydrolysis of holocellulose. In addition, PASC is amorphous cellulose, and its degradation is mainly affected by EG activity. Reduced EG activity by lignin adsorption weakened the enzymatic hydrolysis of PASC. Moreover, avicel is a kind of cellulose that exhibits a highly crystalline structure, and CBH is the main enzyme that hydrolyzes avicel.

Alternative methods based on the principle of least action have been suggested5,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.

To enhance the convergence of ADMD calculations, Lee et al.20,21,22,23 introduced a kinetic energy penalty term based on the equipartition theorem. Although the ADMD approaches yield physically relevant pathways, they have two practical limitations20,24: (a) they strongly depend on the initial guesses of a pathway; and (b) they cannot identify the relative dominance of multiple pathways because the classical principle of least action is an extremum principle25.",

These controlled changes in the molecular wave function alter the probability of rotational de-excitation, a process which involves losing meV of rotational energy, an energy mismatch of nine orders of magnitude with respect to the control energy. The fact that coherent manipulations of the mJ quantum states, alter the de-excitation probability, is in line with various previous results for gas phase, gas-surface and even gas-liquid collisions, which demonstrate the impact of stereodynamics on molecular collisions, see for example ref. 21,29–34.",

The microspheres prepared by high voltage electrostatic system exhibited a rougher outer surface and narrower size distribution. These microspheres were then used as an added constituent to commercially available PMMA bone cement. Four modified cement composites that were prepared with different composition ratios of the two kinds of chitosan/β-TCP microspheres that were made from emulsion technique (C1P1 and C2P1) and from a process by a high voltage electrostatic system (EC1P1 and EC2P1) were compared with the PMMA cement (Pure P). The characteristics of these materials indicate that with the addition of chitosan/β -TCP microspheres as a constituent into the PMMA cement significantly decreases the curing peak temperature. Furthermore, the setting time increases from 3.5-min to 9-min, as compared to the PMMA cement. These changes could be beneficial for the handling of the bone cement paste and causing less damage to the surrounding tissues. Understandably, the presence of chitosan/β -TCP microspheres in the prepared composites reduced the ultimate compressive strength and bending strength.

Here we provide evidence for several simultaneous developments that took place over the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition: expansion of siliceous sponges, decrease of the dissolved organic carbon pool, enhanced organic carbon burial, increased phosphorus removal and seawater oxygenation. This evidence is based on silicon and carbon stable isotopes, Ge/Si ratios, REE-geochemistry and redox-sensitive elements in a chert-shale succession from the Yangtze Platform, China.

The genes responsible for glycerol oxidation pathway into glycolysis, glycerol dehydrogenase and dihydroxyacetone kinase (dhaD1, c12150 and dhaK, c12160), are sequentially located in a likely operon with the glycerol uptake gene glpF (c12170) (Fig. 5a). It should be noted, though, that three additional glycerol dehydrogenase paralogs are located throughout the genome (gldA1, c28060, 29 % identical to dhaD1 by protein; gldA2, c33610, 27 %; and dhaD2, c38340, 43 %). The genes for the reductive pathway to PDO are also colocated in a likely operon (Fig. 5b). The propanediol dehydratase is encoded by three genes (pduE, c22790; pduD, c22800; and dhaB, c22810), which precede a diol dehydratase-reactivating factor gene (ddrA, c22780) and the PDO dehydrogenase (dhaT2, c22740). The PDO dehydrogenase also has an extra copy (dhaT1, c11040, 43 % identical by protein). The presence of these multiple gene paralogs suggests their likely importance in achieving the fast rates of glycerol utilization and growth on glycerol.",

        "input": "Vapor extraction (VAPEX) has been proposed as an alternative for heavy-oil recovery in reservoirs where thermal methods face technical and economic problems. In VAPEX, a pair of horizontal injector-producer wells is employed. The gaseous hydrocarbon solvent (normally propane or a mixture of methane–propane or propane–butane) is injected from the top well and the diluted oil drains downward by gravity to the bottom producer. Recently, the idea of incorporation of CO2 into the gaseous hydrocarbon mixture has emerged. Incorporation of CO2 is believed to make the process more economical and environmentally and technically attractive. CO2 is cheaper than the hydrocarbon gases and has higher solubility into the heavy oil than most of the hydrocarbon gases. It also adds value to the environmental side of the process as CO2 can be sequestered while improving the VAPEX performance at the same time. Moreover, the addition of CO2 to the injected gas increases the dew point of the solvent mixture, and solvent mixtures with higher dew point can be used in heavy-oil reservoirs with higher pressure in which the mixture of hydrocarbon gases may partly condense, which decreases the VAPEX efficacy. Thus, the advantage of incorporating CO2 into the injected solvent is threefold. The objective of this work, therefore, is to simulate the performance of the VAPEX process when different solvent mixtures, including hydrocarbon gases and CO2, are incorporated with the aim of improving its performance. The design and the major results of the simulation for the CO2-based VAPEX process are discussed.",

The advantage of this coupling reaction using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry and formation of the amide bond is its stability and reducing nonspecific interactions among aptamers . Aptamers could be modified with primary amine or thiol group and covalently conjugated to activate carboxyl or pyrrole group of maleimide, respectively . Aptamers modified with thiol group were conjugated to the maleimide functional group of DSPE-PEG2000. Then, DSPE-PEG2000-aptamer post-inserted into a the liposome structure to decorated the outer surface of liposomes . One important limitation with maleimide thiol chemistry is that during storage the thiol group of aptamers may be affected by oxidation and leading to formation of disulfide bond (S-S) between two thiol modified aptamers.

        "input": "BackgroundIsopentenols, such as prenol and isoprenol, are promising advanced biofuels because of their higher energy densities and better combustion efficiencies compared with ethanol. Microbial production of isopentenols has been developed recently via metabolically engineered E. coli. However, current yields remain low and the underlying pathways require systematic optimization.ResultsIn this study, we targeted the E. coli native 2-methyl-(D)-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway and its upstream glycolysis pathway for the optimization of isopentenol production. Two codon optimized genes, nudF and yhfR from Bacillus subtilis, were synthesized and expressed in E. coli W3110 to confer the isopentenol production of the strain. Two key enzymes (IspG and Dxs) were then overexpressed to optimize the E. coli native MEP pathway, which led to a significant increase (3.3-fold) in isopentenol production. Subsequently, the glycolysis pathway was tuned to enhance the precursor and NADPH supplies for the MEP pathway by activating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and Entner-Doudoroff pathway (ED), which resulted in additional 1.9 folds of increase in isopentenol production. A 5 L-scale batch cultivation experiment was finally implemented, showing a total of 61.9 mg L−1 isopentenol production from 20 g L−1 of glucose.ConclusionThe isopentenol production was successfully increased through multi-step optimization of the MEP and its upstream glycolysis pathways. It demonstrated that the total fluxes and their balance of the precursors of the MEP pathway are of critical importance in isopentenol production. In the future, an elucidation of the contribution of PPP and ED to MEP is needed for further optimization of isopentenol production.",

        "input": "Diamond-like carbon (DLC) film has been developed as an extremely effective lubricant to reduce energy dissipation; however, most films should undergo running-in to achieve a super-low friction state. In this study, the running-in behaviors of an H-DLC/Al2O3 pair were investigated through a controllable single-asperity contact study using an atomic force microscope. This study presents direct evidence that illustrates the role of transfer layer formation and oxide layer removal in the friction reduction during running-in. After 200 sliding cycles, a thin transfer layer was formed on the Al2O3 tip. Compared with a clean tip, this modified tip showed a significantly lower adhesion force and friction force on the original H-DLC film, which confirmed the contribution of the transfer layer formation in the friction reduction during running-in. It was also found that the friction coefficient of the H-DLC/Al2O3 pair decreased linearly as the oxygen concentration of the H-DLC substrate surface decreased. This phenomenon can be explained by a change in the contact surface from an oxygen termination with strong hydrogen bond interactions to a hydrogen termination with weak van der Waals interactions. These results provide new insights that quantitatively reveal the running-in mechanism at the nanoscale, which may help with the design optimization of DLC films for different environmental applications.",

Since the first attempts in the late '80s , surface display is steadily gaining popularity and has been explored in most industrially relevant microbial platforms. Nonetheless, E. coli remains the most frequently used organism for surface display with a great variety of membrane anchors available . Herein, we present a method for surface display expression of PETase variants using E. coli protein production strain BL21(DE3). This expression strategy allows for quick screening of the produced variants, where the lysis step and the formation of inclusion bodies are avoided.

Therefore, the development of renewable and sustainable luminogens with anti-quenching function in the solid state, as well as to unveil the key factors that influence their luminescence behavior become highly significant. Herein, a new class of natural rosin-derived luminogens with aggregation-induced emission property (AIEgens) have been facilely obtained with good biocompatibility and targeted organelle imaging capability as well as photochromic behavior in the solid state. Mechanistic study indicates that the introduction of the alicyclic moiety helps suppress the excited-state molecular motion to enhance the solid-state emission. The current work fundamentally elucidates the role of alicyclic moiety in luminogen design and practically demonstrates a new source to large-scalely obtain biocompatible AIEgens.",

The decrease in strength showed, however, the opposite trend; it was smaller for unreinforced PA12 (44%) than its composite (49%). This is probably related to the residual stresses along the fiber-matrix interface, which built up during the fuel sorption due to the large swelling difference between the polymer matrix and glass fiber and initiated the fracture of the composite samples at a smaller strain during the tensile testing. The GF30-PPA sample showed a somewhat larger decrease in Young’s modulus and tensile strength during ageing than the GF23-PA12 sample, which was caused by the more severe deterioration of the fiber-matrix interfacial bond in the former sample (described below).",

In the optimized condition, a field with an intensity of 7.5–9.0 kV/cm was applied to a cuvette (0.2 cm gap) containing a mixture of plasmid and late cell suspended in exponential phase to form a 5 ms pulse in a sucrose-containing buffer. Afterwards, the putative promoter and the 5′-UTR of xyl-doc cluster were determined by sequence alignment. It is indicated that xyl-doc possesses a long conservative 5′-UTR with a complex secondary structure encompassing at least two perfect stem-loops which are potential candidates for controlling the transcriptional termination. In the last step, we employed an oxygen-independent flavin-based fluorescent protein (FbFP) as a quantitative reporter to analyze promoter activity and 5′-UTR function in vivo. It revealed that 5′-UTR significantly blocked transcription of downstream genes, but corn stover can relieve its suppression.",

These patterns bear striking similarity to the open ocean and support a similar mechanism for low-sulfate environments whereby pelagic barite precipitation is closely coupled to heterotrophic remineralization of organic matter16. We augment these results with barium-isotopic analyses of the oldest barites on Earth—deposits from the Paleoarchaean Dresser Formation—that reveal compositions consistent with a pelagic origin.

We reveal that epigallocatechin gallate and tannic acid inhibit amyloid-like fibrillation of adenine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. Moreover, the compounds reduce the cytotoxicity triggered by these assemblies. In contrast, acetylsalicylic acid, used as a control does not have an inhibitory effect. The compounds’ differential effects at various time points is consistent with molecular dynamics simulations, providing information about the inhibition mechanisms and inhibitors’ key interactions with the monomeric and subsequent crystalline fibril states.

Earlier precipitation of the shorter oligomers eventually results in a larger number of smaller particles.

        "input": "BackgroundThe green fluorescent protein has revolutionized many areas of cell biology and biotechnology since it is widely used in determining gene expression and for localization of protein expression. Expression of recombinant GFP in E. coli K12 host from pBAD24M-GFP construct upon arabinose induction was significantly lower than that seen in E. coli B cells with higher expression at 30°C as compared to 37°C in E. coli K12 hosts. Since OmpT levels are higher at 37°C than at 30°C, it prompted us to modify the OmpT proteolytic sites of GFP and examine such an effect on GFP expression and fluorescence. Upon modification of one of the two putative OmpT cleavage sites of GFP, we observed several folds enhanced fluorescence of GFP as compared to unmodified GFPuv (Wild Type-WT). The western blot studies of the WT and the SDM II GFP mutant using anti-GFP antibody showed prominent degradation of GFP with negligible degradation in case of SDM II GFP mutant while no such degradation of GFP was seen for both the clones when expressed in BL21 cells. The SDM II GFP mutant also showed enhanced GFP fluorescence in other E. coli K12 OmpT hosts like E. coli JM109 and LE 392 in comparison to WT GFPuv. Inclusion of an OmpT inhibitor, like zinc with WT GFP lysate expressed from an E. coli K12 host was found to reduce degradation of GFP fluorescence by two fold.ResultsWe describe the construction of two GFP variants with modified putative OmpT proteolytic sites by site directed mutagenesis (SDM). Such modified genes upon arabinose induction exhibited varied degrees of GFP fluorescence. While the mutation of K79G/R80A (SDM I) resulted in dramatic loss of fluorescence activity, the modification of K214A/R215A (SDM II) resulted in four fold enhanced fluorescence of GFP.ConclusionsThis is the first report on effect of OmpT protease site modification on GFP fluorescence. The wild type and the GFP variants showed similar growth profile in bioreactor studies with similar amounts of recombinant GFP expressed in the soluble fraction of the cell. Our observations on higher levels of fluorescence of SDM II GFP mutant over native GFPuv in an OmpT+ host like DH5α, JM109 and LE392 at 37°C reiterates the role played by host OmpT in determining differences in fluorescent property of the expressed GFP. Both the WT GFP and the SDM II GFP plasmids in E. coli BL21 cells showed similar expression levels and similar GFP fluorescent activity at 37°C. This result substantiates our hypothesis that OmpT protease could be a possible factor responsible for reducing the expression of GFP at 37°C for WT GFP clone in K12 hosts like DH5α, JM109, LE 392 since the levels of GFP expression of SDM II clone in such cells at 37°C is higher than that seen with WT GFP clone at the same temperature.",

In particular, Bioactive Molecules with Protease activity (BMP), acting in a temperature range of 4- 30°C, were tested for the hydrolysis of protein layers on laboratory specimens. The cleaning protocol provides a selective procedure to avoid damage to the original materials constituting the heritage object.Concurrently, enzymatic cleaning was also performed using commercial Protease from Aspergillus sojae (Type XIX), in order to compare their hydrolytic activities. Bioactive Molecules with Antimicrobial activity (BMA1, BMA2) were tested to control bacterial (Bacillus, Micrococcus) or fungal (Aspergillus, Penicillium) growth, previously isolated from colonized canvas samples and characterized by an integrated approach based on in vitro culture, microscopy and molecular investigations. These molecules were tested to define the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal/ Fungicidal Concentration (MBC/MFC).

Both AA and HQ are mild reducing agents; however, AA has a relatively stronger reducing power than HQ. Therefore, when HQ was used, the aspect ratio of Au NRs could be easily controlled, as it provides sufficient time to grow the Au NRs because of the slower reaction rate that can be controlled by adjusting the volume of the reducing agent. In contrast, controlling the aspect ratio was challenging when AA was used, even if the volume of the reducing agent was adjusted owing to fast reduction. Further, Au NRs synthesized by mixing the two reducing agents at different volume ratios showed high aspect ratios and a more redshifted λLmax compared to those prepared using only AA or HQ.

        "input": "The native palmitoyl transferase (PAT) for Ras is a hetero-oligomer of two large, multi-pass membrane proteins (the catalytic DHHC9 and co-enzyme GCP16)27, presenting a significant hurdle for biochemical purification. Additionally, the 23 mammalian PATs show significant redundancy and substrate overlap, suggesting that inhibition of solely DHHC9/GCP may not efficaciously inhibit all Ras palmitoylation. Together, these factors recommend the target-based approach (rather than enzyme-based), which has recently been successful in identifying a target-specific N-acylation inhibitor30. Here, the enzyme is not purified, but rather included in a cellular membrane preparation from cells with known Ras-palmitoylation activity31, as previously demonstrated32. We confirmed that this preparation contains the necessary machinery for in vitro Ras palmitoylation-depalmitoylation activity by a novel, click chemistry-based fluorogenic palmitoylation detection scheme (Fig. 2B). Using the biorthogonal probe ω-alkyne palmitoyl coenzyme A (alk–palm–CoA), we were able to detect and quantify N-Ras palmitoylation using a novel fluorogenic probe CalFluor 48833,34, which is essentially non-fluorescent until it participates in 1, 3-dipolar cycloaddition (click) reaction with an alkyne-containing moiety (Fig. S1). Thus, in our assay, background-subtracted fluorescent signal is the direct result of, and is stoichiometric to, the levels of N-Ras palmitoylation.",

However, the restoration of brittle archaeological silver artifacts by thermal treatment has never been quantitatively and systematically studied due to the lack of sufficient experimental samples. Herein, the simulated Ag–Cu alloy flake samples with intergranular corrosion consistent with those brittle archaeological silver artifacts were prepared through two-step annealing and accelerated aging in Fe(NO3)3 + AgNO3 solution. The changes in the microstructure and mechanical strength (σbb, Eb, and HV) of the brittle samples after thermal treatments were studied with the help of SEM–EDS, metallographic observation, three-point bending tests, and microhardness tests. In addition, the most suitable conditions for the restoration of the brittle samples were summarized by the temperature–time (T-t) map obtained from a series of comprehensive thermal treatments. Moreover, the differences in microstructures and mechanical strength between the brittle samples annealed in an aerobic/anaerobic environment were revealed.

These covalent bonds effectively improve the chemical barrier and insensitivity of tellurium hexanitride during blasting, which prevents the decomposition of solid cyclo-N6 salts into molecular nitrogen.

The chemical impurity of 99mTc, that reflects the composition of non-radioactive components, may originate from the generator bed or from the eluent. The most probable chemical impurity that may be detected in the eluent is aluminum. In general, the generator column is prepared using aluminum oxide (alumina) as a support for the parent 99Mo. Aluminum cations can be formed during adsorption of 99Mo as the bed is expose to acidic pH condition.

The four-atom primitive cell of delafossite structure CuAlO2 leads to 12 normal modes, but only the A1g (416 cm−1) and Eg (771 cm−1) modes are Raman active. As shown in Fig. 1b, it is obvious that two Raman vibration modes, A1g and Eg, both are present for all films . Unlike bulk analysis of XRD, Raman scattering originates from the molecular vibration and lattice vibration that can detect Raman active molecule vibrate from a very small amount of concentration. That explains the existence of CuAlO2 phase in the 700 °C annealed film, which is not observable in XRD spectrum. Others peaks at 798 cm−1, 297 cm−1, and 632 cm−1 were also observed which are assigned to the F2g mode of CuAl2O4, Ag, and Bg modes of CuO, respectively . The peaks of CuO and CuAl2O4 phases decrease as the annealing temperature increases from 700 to 1000 °C, and both phases convert to phase CuAlO2 after 1000 °C annealing, which is consistent with XRD results.",

        "input": "Untreated SCB shows remarkable crystal structure as the strong peaks at 2θ about 14°–17°, 21°–22°, and 34.8°, corresponding to 1–10, 110, and 200 planes of crystalline cellulose I . SCB contains a certain amount of amorphous lignin and hemicellulose, which contribute to the relatively weaker diffraction of 1–10, 110, and 004 planes and the overlap of 1–10 and 110 planes compared with pure cellulose . Clearly, intense milling caused the destruction of ordered crystal structure and macromolecular chains of cellulose, leading to a significant decrease in the intensity of the characteristic peaks of crystalline cellulose. With the presence of metal salt in ball milling, the crystal structure of cellulose was damaged more seriously. The CrI of untreated SCB was 52.6%, but decreased to 22.0%, 14.1%, 15.5%, 15.2%, and 14.6% after MA, MA + AlCl3, MA + FeCl3, MA + Al(NO3)3, and MA + Fe(NO3)3 pretreatment, respectively. MAMS pretreatment exhibited outstanding effect on breaking the crystal structure of cellulose in SCB, demonstrating the synergistic interaction of MA and metal salt. The outer layer of lignocellulose was first disrupted by MA to provide easy access for metal salt to the interior for further action of MA and metal salt on lignocellulose, attributing to a remarkable reduction in the crystallinity of cellulose. The crystallinity of lignocellulosic biomass has been regarded as a major factor that influences enzymatic hydrolysis , so the pretreated SCB with lower CrI exhibited higher saccharification yield. Moreover, it can be noticed that the saccharification yield of pretreated SCB was not linearly proportional to the CrI, especially the MAMS-pretreated SCB with similar CrI had different saccharification yields, implying that the destruction of crystal structure of cellulose is not the only major influencing factor. Therefore, further investigations should be performed to analyze other factors that affect the saccharification efficiency of SCB.",

The use of these materials as culture media to produce the enzymes can contribute to the profitability of the recycling process and to the circular economy. The aim of this work is the construction of a recombinant yeast strain efficient to grow in mixed whey (residue of cheese making) and beet molasses (residue of sugar manufacture) as culture medium, and to produce heterologous α-galactosidase, an enzyme with varied industrial applications and wide market.ResultsThe gene MEL1, encoding the α-galactosidase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was integrated (four copies) in the LAC4 locus of the Kluyveromyces lactis industrial strain GG799. The constructed recombinant strain produces high levels of extracellular α-galactosidase under the control of the LAC4 promoter, inducible by lactose and galactose, and the native MEL1 secretion signal peptide. K. lactis produces natively beta-galactosidase and invertase thus metabolizing the sugars of whey and molasses. A culture medium based on whey and molasses was statistically optimized, and then the cultures scaled-up at laboratory level, thus obtaining 19 U/mL of heterologous α-galactosidase with a productivity of 0.158 U/L h, which is the highest value reported hitherto from a cheap waste-based medium.ConclusionsA K. lactis recombinant strain was constructed and a sustainable culture medium, based on a mixture of cheese whey and beet molasses, was optimized for high productivity of S. cerevisiae α-galactosidase, thus contributing to the circular economy by producing a heterologous enzyme from two agro-industrial wastes.",

Previously, we developed a nanosuspension consisting of the synthetic TLR4 ligand glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This nanosuspension is a clinical vaccine adjuvant known as GLA-AF. We examined the effects of DPPC supplier, buffer composition, and manufacturing process on GLA-AF physicochemical and biological activity characteristics.ResultsDPPC from different suppliers had minimal influence on physicochemical and biological effects. In general, buffered compositions resulted in less particle size stability compared to unbuffered GLA-AF. Microfluidization resulted in rapid particle size reduction after only a few passes, and 20,000 or 30,000 psi processing pressures were more effective at reducing particle size and recovering the active component than 10,000 psi. Sonicated and microfluidized batches maintained good particle size and chemical stability over 6 months, without significantly altering in vitro or in vivo bioactivity of GLA-AF when combined with a recombinant malaria vaccine antigen.ConclusionsMicrofluidization, compared to water bath sonication, may be an effective manufacturing process to improve the scalability and reproducibility of GLA-AF as it advances further in the clinical development pathway.

        "input": "Figure 8 indicates that by increasing the ratio of formation brine to injection water, the barium sulfate scale tendency increases to a maximum before decreasing. It can be explained that by increasing the mixing ratio, the concentration of barium ions in the brines mixture increases. The increase of barium cations concentration leads to the increase of ionic activity which consequently increases the scaling tendency. As the mixing ratio increases, the salinity of brines mixture also increases and leads to an increase in the solubility product of BaSO4. In fact, at higher salinities, the effect of salinity prevails ions concentration and reduces the scaling tendency. Since the maximum amount of scale is formed at 90% formation water, the scale formation tendency of brines mixture reaches the minimum value. Comparing Fig. 8a, b show that barium sulfate scale tendency and saturation index are reduced by increasing the temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that the potential of barium sulfate scale precipitation is much higher at wellhead conditions than in reservoir formation.",

Comparison between the hydrothermal Re-Os molybdenite ages and magmatic zircon U–Pb ages requires that systematic uncertainties, relating to the tracer calibrations and decay constant intercalibration, must be considered, which typically equate to ± 0.8 Myrs on Re-Os dates and ~  ± 0.08 Myrs for U–Pb (Refer to Supplementary Data   2). Results therefore indicate some component of porphyry-style mineralisation within the Ann Mason deposit could potentially have occurred coincident with the eruption of the younger propylitically altered components of the Fulstone volcanics (BS16), at 166.285 ± 0.059 Ma (Fig. S7).

Frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, insertion/deletion mutations and splice site mutations have also been reported . FH catalyzes the conversion of fumaric acid to malic acid in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The functional defect caused by the inactivation mutation of the FH gene leads to the accumulation of FH and a decrease in iron levels in cells, which inhibits hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase and increases the level of intracellular HIF.

These materials often contain structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies. Understanding the role of these defects on ferroelectric switching as well as on electronic transport properties of FTJs is of critical importance. Second, the current theoretical methodology, in particular DFT-based calculations, describes very well the effect of the electronic screening of the polarisation and the interface bonding effect at zero bias. However, the finite bias regime and the effects appearing at finite bias are still largely unexplored. Thus, methodology improvements to target these regimes are necessary. Third, a potentially interesting research direction is the extension of the functionality of the devices using more complex materials with multiple and possibly coupled ferroic orders, such as single-phase magnetoelectric multiferroics. Finally, exploration of other ferroelectric materials, such as organic ferroelectrics that could preserve ferroelectricity at monolayer thickness, would be interesting.",

By sequential use of diluted H2SO4 and NaOH pretreatment, 88% of hemicellulose and 64.4% of lignin within buriti (Mauritia flexuosa) endocarp were removed, respectively, which lead to a glucose yield of 86% . Steam-explosion pretreated olive stones (200–236 °C for 2–4 min) contributed to an 87.7% glucose yield in first 8 h of saccharification . It is well known that low pH pretreatment technologies contribute more to the hydrolysis of hemicellulose, while high pH value strategies are mainly directed at lignin but leave a large portion of hemicellulose in the pretreated solid . Our results suggest that DES pretreatment is highly effective in lignin removal, which agrees with previous reports on choline chloride/lactic acid (ChCl:Lac) based DES pretreatment of poplar and Douglas fir , rice straw , and willow .

The relatively small (~60%) volumetric expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheets during the lithiation process was confirmed by in situ transmission electron microscopy and is attributed to their mesoporous nature. The 3D network structure of NiCo2S4 nanosheets offers the additional advantages of large surface area, efficient electron and ion transport capability, easy access of electrolyte to the electrode surface, sufficient void space and mechanical robustness. The fabricated electrodes exhibited outstanding lithium-storage performance including high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability and high rate of performance. A reversible capacity of ~1275 mAh g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1000 mA g−1, and the devices retained ~1137 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, which is the highest value reported to date for electrodes made of metal sulfide nanostructures or their composites.

This demonstrates that the components are immiscible, the extent of which is dependent upon variations in composition.The morphology of the semi-IPNs was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy and tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TMAFM). The micrographs of the semi-IPNs and TMAFM phase images indicated that distinct phase separation at the nanometer scale is observed.The mechanical properties reflect the changes in structure of semi-IPNs with composition.

Consequently, stress-based strategies are widely used as environmentally friendly approaches to induce lipid overproduction in cultured microorganisms . However, stress-based strategies usually work at the expense of lower biomass. A general countermeasure to overcome this difficulty is to use a two-stage cultivation strategy, dedicating the first stage with optimum growth conditions to the maximization of biomass production, while reserving the second stage for the accumulation of lipids under stress conditions. However, such multi-stage cultivation strategies consume more energy, and the exact time-point of switching the conditions for fermentation control is difficult to determine accurately, leading to high costs and production instability . Consequently, stable mutants with improved tolerance to the process conditions should be developed to enhance lipid yield.",

An equally important component in this paradigm is the corresponding ability to synthesize these promising materials and compositions. However, techniques for experimental synthesis of materials have not kept pace with advances in computational materials screening17,18. As a result, materials synthesis is largely dominated by individual groups that can identify synthesis strategies for advanced materials based on empirically insights and materials intuition. There are several attempted strategies to identify and optimize synthesis routes prior to actual synthesis. The first strategy, common in chemical and biological synthesis of small molecules, uses high-throughput experimental synthesis to screen for optimal synthesis precursors for chemical synthesis of small molecules19–22. The effectiveness of such strategies is limited since an exhaustive search of synthesis strategies is prohibitively expensive and inefficient in regard to time and reagents, whereas a narrow search scheme that varies only a single synthesis parameter at a time will likely miss several promising synthesis strategies.",

We demonstrate that even in the absence of chemically diverse plant inputs, our model sugar- and syringol-treated soils have a molecular composition and diversity resembling both soils treated with more heterogeneous plant inputs (DOC) and natural field soils (Fig. 1). This highlights the influence of microbial processing on SOM chemistry observed in soils under complex plant communities49,50,51, but also that SOM chemical heterogeneity can originate from microbial metabolism of relatively simple C substrates such as root exudates or the soluble components in leaf litter.

Our results indicate that the resonant condition for achieving the Rabi splitting in the IR spectrum and the resonant condition for achieving a maximum suppression of the reaction rate constant are fundamentally different.

In short, no other process condition demonstrated the equivalent level of electrical conductivity improvement as described above. First, the heating-only treatment was carried out at 900 and 1500 °C in an Ar ambient for 5 h. Similar to the results observed for CNTs, heating-only showed observable improvement at temperatures at, or above, 1500 °C . As summarized in Fig. 2a (green), treatment at 900 °C resulted in a nominal improvement in electrical conductivity (1215 ± 70 S·cm−1), and treatment at 1500 °C resulted in a more significant increase to ~ 1812 ± 79 S·cm−1. In addition, in both cases, we observed a slight weight (~ 3%) decrease, which is likely due to the removal, perhaps degassing, of residual chemicals remaining from the exfoliation process. These results show that heating alone can be effective in improving the electrical conductivity of graphite sheets, but it requires temperatures exceeding 1500 °C and requires treatment time of hours.",

Notably, PtSe2 can be grown at low temperature making it potentially suitable for industrial usage. Here, we address thickness-dependent transport properties and investigate electrical contacts to PtSe2, a crucial and universal element of TMD-based electronic devices. PtSe2 films have been synthesized at various thicknesses and structured to allow contact engineering and the accurate extraction of electrical properties. Contact resistivity and sheet resistance extracted from transmission line method (TLM) measurements are compared for different contact metals and different PtSe2 film thicknesses. Furthermore, the transition from semimetal to semiconductor in PtSe2 has been indirectly verified by electrical characterization in field-effect devices. Finally, the influence of edge contacts at the metal–PtSe2 interface has been studied by nanostructuring the contact area using electron beam lithography. By increasing the edge contact length, the contact resistivity was improved by up to 70% compared to devices with conventional top contacts.

This intact aroK fragment was cloned into pK18mobsacB EcoRI/HindIII sites. The resulting plasmid was named pK18mobsacB-aroK, and was amplified with primers KTaroK-F and KTaroK-R, thus resulting DNA fragments with disrupted aroK gene. After digested with XmaI restriction endonuclease, DNA fragments were ligated and transformed into E. coli. The recombinant plasmid was named pK18mobsacB-∆aroK and was electroporated into C. glutamicum RES167. Using the method described by Schäfer et al. , the aroK mutant RES167∆aroK was screened out on BHI agar plates.

        "input": "BackgroundThe effect of high glucose concentration on the transcription levels of the small RNA SgrS and the messenger RNA ptsG, (encoding the glucose transporter IICBGlc), was studied in both E. coli K-12 (MG1655 and JM109) and E. coli B (BL21). It is known that the transcription level of sgrS increases when E. coli K-12 (MG1655 and JM109) is exposed to the non-metabolized glucose alpha methyl glucoside (αMG) or when the bacteria with a defective glycolysis pathway is grown in presence of glucose. The increased level of sRNA SgrS reduces the level of the ptsG mRNA and consequently lowers the level of the glucose transporter IICBGlc. The suggested trigger for this action is the accumulation of the corresponding phospho-sugars.ResultsIn the course of the described work, it was found that E. coli B (BL21) and E. coli K-12 (JM109 and MG1655) responded similarly to αMG: both strains increased SgrS transcription and reduced ptsG transcription. However, the two strains reacted differently to high glucose concentration (40 g/L). E. coli B (BL21) reacted by increasing sgrS transcription and reducing ptsG transcription while E. coli K-12 (JM109 and MG1655) did not respond to the high glucose concentration, and, therefore, transcription of sgrS was not detected and ptsG mRNA level was not affected.ConclusionsThe results suggest that E. coli B (BL21) tolerates high glucose concentration not only by its more efficient central carbon metabolism, but also by controlling the glucose transport into the cells regulated by the sRNA SgrS, which may suggest a way to control glucose consumption and increase its efficient utilization.",

Although the predictions of the ML-BKS-Solids model are a significant improvement over the existing parameterizations for the crystalline silica polymorphs properties when compared to experiments, we find that ML-BKS-Solids is unstable for the modeling of the liquid phase. We systematically compare the various pairwise interactions and conclude that the dynamic instability arises from the lack of repulsive interactions at short distances in the Si–Si interaction of ML-BKS-Solids. Such issues with dynamical stabilities have also been observed in prior parameterizations of BKS-type models, and the PSO models include a D r−24 term to avoid them. Here, we opt for the addition of a computationally efficient, shifted LJ repulsive term analogous to the WCA functional form for the Si–Si interaction.

This has been experimentally confirmed by Revol et al.37 and Kimura et al.80 The latter team found that the application of a moderate field of 1 T over a few hours can give good results. The procedure should work best for suspensions toward the low-concentration side of the cholesteric regime, which minimizes the viscosity.

The main advantage of having GO as surfactant to stabilize carbon allotropes lies on its chemical compound which mostly contains conjugated carbon to carbon bonding as well as the two-dimensional configuration which serves to improve material functionalities . Further treatment of GO can be performed in presence of other carbon allotropes which would theoretically enhance the overall composites .",

Mattinen et al. found that cellohexaose adsorbed on the TrCBM1, whereas short cellooligosaccharides, such as cellobiose and cellotriose, did not bind to TrCBM1 . Based on these results and our observations, stacking on the flat plane surface of TrCBM1 and interactions with the cleft required lignin and cellooligosaccharides with long chains. The low affinity of the short-chain lignin model could also be attributed to its conformation. The short-chain lignin model adopted a folded conformation in 90% water , and the folded short lignin chain could not cover the full length of the three tyrosine residues on the flat plane surface of TrCBM1.

This study investigated the different phases of ZIF-8 development (nucleation, crystallization, growth, and stationary periods) and reported an overview of its crystal transformation kinetics. Time-dependent evolution of ZIF-8 size was confirmed through TEM analysis of samples synthesized at various durations from 10 min to 24 h. ZIF-8 crystals evolved from spherical particles with a size of 50 nm into well-defined polyhedral crystals with sizes of approximately 500 nm, where faceted crystals were formed starting at 60 min of synthesis.

        "input": "BackgroundXylanase is an important component of hemicellulase enzyme system. Since it plays an important role in the hydrolysis of hemicellulose into xylooligosaccharides (XOs), high thermostable xylanase has been the focus of much recent attention as powerful enzyme as well as in the field of biomass utilization.ResultsA xylanase gene (xyn10A) with 3,474 bp was cloned from the extremely thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga thermarum that encodes a protein containing 1,158 amino acid residues. Based on amino acid sequence homology, hydrophobic cluster and three dimensional structure analyses, it was attested that the xylanase belongs to the glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 10 with five carbohydrate binding domains. When the xylanase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), the specific enzyme activity of xylanase produced by the recombinant strain was up to 145.8 U mg-1. The xylanase was optimally active at 95°C, pH 7.0. In addition, it exhibited high thermostability over broad range of pH 4.0-8.5 and temperature 55-90°C upon the addition of 5 mM Ca2+. Confirmed by Ion Chromatography System (ICS) analysis, the end products of the hydrolysis of beechwood xylan were xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, xylopentaose and xylohexaose.ConclusionsThe xylanase from T. thermarum is one of the hyperthermophilic xylanases that exhibits high thermostability, and thus, is a suitable candidate for generating XOs from cellulosic materials such as agricultural and forestry residues for the uses as prebiotics and precursors for further preparation of furfural and other chemicals.",

We assist these findings by exploring a vast array of configurations of computer-generated nanoparticles. We find that these groups are mainly disposed along rows at edges of sheets of iron octahedra. Molecular dynamics of nanoparticles as large as 10 nm show that the most reactive surface hydroxo groups are predominantly free, yet are hydrogen bond acceptors in an intricate network formed with less reactive groups.

The Si3N4 used in the study is comprised of single crystal fibres with sub-micrometre diameter and length < 25 μm. The size of the fibre is smaller than the metal matrix powder allowing it to coat the metal powder before consolidation rather than forming agglomerations that might lead to pores and poor mechanical properties. We investigated the effects of Si3N4 fibre additions on the densification, hardness, elastic modulus and tensile strength. The experimental results found that the Si3N4 fibre effectively enhanced the mechanical properties of the composites at low additions. The microstructural analysis clearly shows the Si3N4 fibres in the sintered grain boundaries. The interface between the fibre and the Alumix123 matrix showed good wetting and bonding with only minimal reaction. The Si3N4 fibre reinforced Alumix123 composites have potential uses in the automobile and aerospace industries due to their improved specific mechanical properties.",

Previous work  has shown that this can correct for mass fractionation during chemical processing, thus obviating the need for full (> 99%) recovery of Ba from the column. In addition, use of a double spike reduces the effects of non-isobaric matrix interferents . Based on error analysis using the double spike tool of Rudge et al. , the 137Ba–135Ba isotope pair was chosen because it optimizes the precise determination of 138Ba/134Ba, whether obtained by direct measurement or calculated based on the measured fractionation in the 138Ba/136Ba ratio. The double spike was made using 135Ba- and 137Ba-enriched carbonate salts from the National Isotope Development Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and calibrated by running mixtures of double spike and NIST 3104a.

One key challenge in fabricating larger perovskite modules is finding a solution-coating method that yields homogeneous perovskite crystallization over large-area substrates4–7. The ability to use “slot-die coating” to deposit films over large areas, for example, would be highly advantageous due to the high-throughput and efficient material use that can be achieved8–10. To control the crystallization of slot-die coated perovskite films, a gas-knife directs a stream of nitrogen gas onto the wet perovskite precursor to locally trigger nucleation11–14. With this “gas-quenching” method, slot-die coated mini modules can be made with 19.4% efficiencies15. During the slot-die coating process, the gas-knife can mechanically deform the wet precursor film and create drying inhomogeneities such as thickness variations, cracks and pinholes. To avoid the formation of morphological defects and to control the final perovskite film thickness, careful optimization of many coating parameters16,17 is therefore required as it remains challenging to obtain homogeneous perovskite films with this technique.",

The equilibrium P–T curve shifted toward a higher pressure and lower temperature zone when the concentration of oil in the emulsion increased. It was inferred from the FTIR that there was less chance of the presence of carboxylic acid groups (or if present not in a detectable amount). This was also suggested from the low acid number of crude oil. The functional groups present were observed from the FTIR which showed –OH, aromatic, and amide groups. From this and satisfactory stability of the O/W emulsion, a consensus was that the surface active asphaltenes might be responsible for such organic inhibition.

The progress of retro-DA reaction with the ultrasonication for polymer containing DAE/DA at the mid-chain (P1) verified that DAE/DA works as a mechanophore. The photo-irradiation for P1 induced the decreasing of cleavage rate of polymer chain. This change derives from the ring-closing reaction of DAE inducing strengthen of structure of DAE/DA mechanophore.

Due to the high viscosity of crude oil, it is not easy to recover. When the viscosity of underground crude oil exceeds 150 cp, the land heavy oil field is generally developed by thermal recovery. S.Z. oilfield is a heavy oil reservoir in the Bohai Sea, with surface crude oil viscosity of 3000–25,000 cp and underground crude oil viscosity of 400–1000 cp. Limited by offshore equipment, the development strategy of land oilfields can't be directly applied. High production capacity is obtained through the cold production development of horizontal branch experimental wells, and the water drive production capacity can reach 40–70 m3/day. At present, there is a lack of research on cold recovery development under the viscosity of crude oil. The existing primary research and common knowledge are challenging to support efficient development technology for effectively producing heavy oil reservoirs. In this paper, through physical simulation experiments, the phase behavior and rheological properties of crude oil in the target block are studied, and the rheological properties of crude oil are clarified. Then, the depletion production and water flooding experiments are carried out, and the displacement characteristics and laws of water flooding cold production are analyzed.

Indeed, upon modest heating of CNTs, binary mixture of water and CO2 confined inside the CNTs will release CO2 molecules and generate high pressure which might help to facilitate drug release from the nanotube at the temperature of the living body.

The optimum result was A2B3C1 for pin weight loss, friction coefficient and wear rate. From the experimental result, it is found that the wear scar diameter increases with the increase of load for lube oil and reduced by addition of percentage of Jatropha oil. Flash temperature parameter was also studied in this experiment and results show that 15% addition of Jatropha oil would result in less possibility to film breakdown.

Upon exposure to the acidic biofilm microenvironment, the acidity-sensitive MOF protective layer was destroyed to release the preloaded diallyl trisulfide. Then, the diallyl trisulfide reacts with glutathione (GSH) to generate H2S gas. Upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser, MSDG-based H2S-sensitized photothermal therapy effectively removed bacterial biofilms by heat-inactivated pathogens and H2S-mediated extracellular DNA removal. The H2S gas from the reaction of diallyl trisulfide and GSH enriched in the biofilm could remodel the immune microenvironment by inducing the production of M2-type macrophages. Then, M2-type macrophages secrete regeneration-associated cytokines to promote wound repair. From the results of immunohistochemistry analysis, high α-SMA and CD31 protein contents were observed, which are myofibroblast and endotheliocyte markers, respectively.

Due to the competition between cationic dyes (MG, RhB) and Na+ ions toward the available adsorption sites, by increasing the ionic strength, the activity of the dyes and the active sites of the sand decreases; hence, the amount of adsorption decreases . On the other hand, for CR, any increase in the ionic strength of the solution leads to the repulsive electrostatic attraction, which leads to adsorption increase . Optimum level for this factor was selected in level 3.",

For cellulose degradation, exoglucanase attacked the natural and LPMO-produced ends of crystalline cellulose, and then the products could be hydrolyzed into glucose by β-glucosidase. The high abundance of these three functional enzymes suggested the specific enhancement of the main steps in the degradation of crystalline cellulose, but not including the endoglucanases, which seemed to have difficulties when attacking the middle of the cellulose chain in the crystalline structure. In contrast, endoxylanase was the largest abundant secreted enzyme among all xylanases, corresponding to the fact that endoxylanase could easily attack the whole chain of xylan for its non-crystalline structure.

Here we report the realization of osmapentalenes, the first planar Möbius aromatic complexes with 16 and 18 valence electron transition metals. The Möbius aromaticity of these osmapentalenes, documented by X-ray structural, magnetic and theoretical analyses, demonstrates the basis of the aromaticity of the parent osmapentalynes. All these osmapentalenes are formed by both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions of the in-plane π component of the same carbyne carbon, illustrating ambiphilic carbyne reactivity, which is seldom observed in transition metal chemistry.

At 96 h, the flux towards the PPP differed between the three groups: with PPG and TIG being 2.96- and 0.34-fold of, respectively, that of SG. The nonoxidative PPP flux generates the nucleotides required for DNA repair , helping cells to tolerate butanol and solvent stress. Furthermore, on the metabolic network map (Figs. 5, 6), xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P), d-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), and d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S7P) form a small loop that directs flux of the PPP flux back into the EMP pathway, potentially enhancing butanol synthesis by increasing the intercellular pyruvate pool.",

While isomerisation is an electron-neutral reaction, the reduction of a misfolded disulfide bond without its ensuing re-oxidation results in an oxidised, inactive isomerase which can be re-reduced and thereby reactivated by DsbD. In similar fashion to DsbB, DsbD is located in the inner membrane and can facilitate electron transfer; however, in this case it transports electrons into the periplasm.

The rules of the CA model are grounded in diffusion probabilities and basic principles of alloy oxidation. Using this approach, we can model the oxide scale thickness and morphology, specific mass change and oxidation kinetics as well as an approximate estimate of the stress and strains in the oxide scale. Furthermore, we also incorporate Hf in the grain boundaries and observe the “reactive element effect”, where doping with Hf results in a drastic reduction in the oxidation kinetics concomitant with the formation of thin, planar oxide scales. Interestingly, although we find that grain boundaries result in rapid oxidation of the undoped NiAl, they result in a slower-growing oxide and a planar oxide/metal interface when doped with Hf.",

        "input": "Compared with traditional lead-acid batteries, nickel–cadmium batteries and nickel-hydrogen batteries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are much more environmentally friendly and much higher energy density. Besides, LIBs own the characteristics of no memory effect, high charging and discharging rate, long cycle life and high energy conversion rate. Therefore, LIBs have been widely considered as the most promising power source for mobile devices. Commonly used LIBs contain carbonate based liquid electrolytes. Such electrolytes own high ionic conductivity and excellent wetting ability. However, the use of highly flammable and volatile organic solvents in them may lead to problems like leakage, thermo runaway and parasitic interface reactions, which limit their application. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) can solve these problems, while they also bring new challenges such as poor interfacial contact with electrodes and low ionic conductivity at room temperature. Many approaches have been tried to solve these problems. This article is divided into three parts to introduce polyethylene oxide (PEO) based polymer-ceramic hybrid solid electrolyte, which is one of the most efficient way to improve the performance of SPEs. The first part focuses on polymer-lithium salt (LiX) matrices, including their ionic conduction mechanism and impact factors for their ionic conductivity. In the second part, the influence of both active and passive ceramic fillers on SPEs are reviewed. In the third part, composite SPEs’ preparation methods, including solvent casting and thermocompression, are introduced and compared. Finally, we propose five key points on how to make composite SPEs with high ionic conductivity for reference.",

However, only a few cements that are in clinical use today are formulated specifically for use in these procedures and even these formulations are not regarded as “ideal” injectable bone cements. The aim of this work is to prepare bioactive bone cements by adding strontium hydroxyapatite (SrHA) to a cement formulation based on polymethylmethacrylate. Thus, the cement combines the immediate mechanical support given by the setting of the acrylic matrix with optimum radiopacity and bioactivity due to the incorporation of the SrHA. Formulations of bioactive cement were prepared with 10 and 20 wt% of SrHA as synthesised and after a surface treatment with the monomer. Cements loaded with treated particles showed an enhancement of their handling properties, and hence, an improvement on their rheological behaviour, injectabilities and compressive parameters. Further experiments were also carried out to determine their bioactivity and biocompatibility and results appear in other publication.",

By tweaking molecular structures and self-assembling the dendrimers into larger organic nanoparticles in water, the researchers synthesized different probes with strong blue, cyan, green and red fluorescence emissions.

We report the sound velocity measurements of a model core composition in the Fe-Ni-Si system at the outer core conditions by shock-wave experiments. Combining with the previous studies, we found that the best estimate for the outer core’s light elements is ~6 wt% Si, ~2 wt% S, and possible ~1–2.5 wt% O.

The market prospect in the nutraceutics industries for this health-protective molecule is very promising. Astaxanthin is synthesized by several bacteria, algae and plants from β-carotene by the sequential action of two enzymes: a β-carotene, 3,3'-hydroxylase that introduces an hydroxyl group at the 3 (and 3') positions of each of the two β-ionone rings of β-carotene, and a β-carotene ketolase that introduces keto groups at carbons 4 and 4' of the β-ionone rings. Astaxanthin is also produced by the yeast-like basidiomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. A gene crtS involved in the conversion of β-carotene to astaxanthin has been cloned simultaneously by two research groups. Complementation studies of X. dendrorhous mutants and expression analysis in Mucor circinelloides reveals that the CrtS enzyme is a β-carotene hydroxylase of the P-450 monooxygenase family that converts β-carotene to the hydroxylated derivatives β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, but it does not form astaxanthin or the ketolated intermediates in this fungus.

PA production was first evaluated in mixed pure sugar streams containing inhibitors while N2 or CO2 was used to maintain an anaerobic environment. The feasibility of producing PA in DDAPH was subsequently examined in batch cultures, and the influence of different nitrogen sources and pH control reagents as well as byproduct accumulation were investigated. To increase PA titer, fed-batch fermentations using concentrated DDAPH in feed media were conducted and LA accumulation was also examined at different levels of nutrient supplementation. Finally, a fed-batch HCD fermentation mode was applied to further improve fermentation performance.

        "input": "BackgroundVarious inhibitors coexist in the hydrolysate derived from lignocellulosic biomass. They inhibit the performance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and further restrict the development of industrial bioethanol production. Transcription factors are regarded as targets for constructing robust S. cerevisiae by genetic engineering. The tolerance-related transcription factors have been successively reported, while their regulatory mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we revealed the regulation mechanisms of Haa1p and Tye7p that had outstanding contributions to the improvement of the fermentation performance and multiple inhibitor tolerance of S. cerevisiae.ResultsComparative transcriptomic analyses were applied to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of Haa1p and Tye7p under mixed sugar fermentation conditions with mixed inhibitors [acetic acid and furfural (AFur)] or without inhibitor (C) using the original strain s6 (S), the HAA1-overexpressing strain s6H3 (H), and the TYE7-overexpressing strain s6T3 (T). The expression of the pathways related to carbohydrate, amino acid, transcription, translation, cofactors, and vitamins metabolism was enhanced in the strains s6H3 and s6T3. Compared to C_H vs. C_S group, the unique DEGs in AFur_H vs. AFur_S group were further involved in oxidative phosphorylation, purine metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, and spliceosome under the regulation of Haa1p. A similar pattern appeared under the regulation of Tye7p, and the unique DEGs in AFur_T vs. AFur_S group were also involved in riboflavin metabolism and spliceosome. The most significant difference between the regulations of Haa1p and Tye7p was the intracellular energy supply. Haa1p preferred to enhance oxidative phosphorylation, while Tye7p tended to upregulate glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.ConclusionsGlobal gene expressions could be rewired with the overexpression of HAA1 or TYE7. The positive perturbations of energy and amino acid metabolism were beneficial to the improvement of the fermentation performance of the strain. Furthermore, strengthening of key cofactor metabolism, and transcriptional and translational regulation were helpful in improving the strain tolerance.

        "input": "BackgroundIn a previous paper, we reported the accomplishment of a cold gene-expression system for the recombinant secretion of heterologous proteins in Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125. This system makes use of the psychrophilic α-amylase from P. haloplanktis TAB23 as secretion carrier, and allows an effective extra-cellular addressing of recombinant proteins. However, Pseudoalteromonales are reported to secrete a wide range of extra-cellular proteases. This feature works against the efficiency of the cold-adapted secretion system, because of the proteolytic degradation of recombinant products. The aim of this study is the construction of a P. haloplanktis TAC125 mutant strain with reduced extra-cellular proteolytic activity.ResultsP. haloplanktis TAC125 culture medium resulted to contain multiple and heterogeneous proteases. Since the annotation of the Antarctic bacterium genome highlighted the presence of only one canonical secretion machinery, namely the Type II secretion pathway (T2SS), we have inactivated this secretion system by a gene insertion strategy. A mutant strain of P. haloplanktis TAC125 in which the gspE gene was knocked-out, actually displayed a remarkable reduction of the extra-cellular protease secretion. Quite interestingly this strain still retained the ability to secrete the psychrophilic amylase as efficiently as the wild type. Moreover, the decrease in extra-cellular proteolytic activity resulted in a substantial improvement in the stability of the secreted amylase-β-lactamase chimera.ConclusionHere we report a cell engineering approach to the construction of a P. haloplanktis TAC125 strain with reduced extra-cellular protease activity. The improved strain is able to secrete the psychrophilic α-amylase (the carrier of our recombinant secretion system), while it displays a significant reduction of protease content in the culture medium. These features make the gspE mutant an improved host with a remarkable biotechnological potential in recombinant protein secretion at low temperature. Moreover this work demonstrates that P. haloplanktis TAC125 is a versatile psychrophilic host for recombinant protein production since it can be easily improved by a directed engineering approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first described example of a strain improvement strategy applied to an Antarctic bacterium.",

In the last decades, many attempts have been made to adsorb heavy metal ions by activated carbon from effluent, which is an effective material for removing Cr ions. However, the high cost of commercial activated carbon limits its wide application in bio-sorption. Consequently, new strategies for Cr (III)/Cr (VI) adsorption have proposed with both low-cost and an excellent adsorption capacity.

Here, negligible shell-pairs can be eliminated by examining their pre-exponential factors to the ERIs, thus reducing the computation effort significantly59, in particular, for large molecules where the AO pairs are more prone to negligible overlap conditions.

The ND-OH nanophase, which was stable over a range of pH, improved mechanical stress compared to ND-COOH, indicating that the stability of inorganic compositing nanophases in an aqueous state is a critical parameter that affects mechanical properties of 3D-printed nanocomposite hydrogels. Herein, we have applied filament-based processing and layer-based deposition at the microscale, resulting in newly generated mechanical properties of nanocomposite hydrogels.

Glucose acts as an osmotic stressor at concentration > 100 mM (around 1.8%) while xylose exerts its stress at concentration > 120 mM (around 1.8%) under similar microaerobic conditions .

However, at inhibitor concentration of 1.6 g/L, only marginal metabolism of furfural was observed for both SSK101 and SSK42 till 96 h; and medium containing SSK101 had relatively lower furfural as compared to the one containing SSK42.",

GRS measures the spectrum of gamma photons emitted from the Martian surface; characteristic spectral peaks from specific nuclear reactions allow the quantification of several major rock-forming elements, along with select minor and trace elements (Al, Ca, Cl, Fe, H, K, S, Si, Th)58. Peak area above the continuum can be used to infer the percentage mass fraction (wt%) of each element over an area of the planet’s surface, leading to chemical abundance maps. Due to the nature of the derivation methods (e.g., elements like Fe and Si, with abundances determined from scatter and capture nuclear reactions from the galactic cosmic flux), the chemical maps are generally restricted to the mid-to-low latitudes (roughly +/−50° latitude) where H abundances are sufficiently low.

Here, we used the heterologous expressed 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS) mutant S1  to produce TAL using malonyl-CoA as a substrate. Therefore, the intracellular malonyl-CoA level was reflected by the TAL concentration, which can be rapidly reported according to the measurement of LacZ activity (Fig. 2a).

Although structures of 2OG oxygenases in complex with hydroxamic acids have been reported, including for FIH43, there are no reported structures of them with cyclic hydroxamic acids or related compounds such as 4. This is of particular interest in part because the natural product alahopcin44,45, which is a procollagen prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor is a cyclic hydroxamic acid and because approximately functionalised cyclic hydroxamic acids might be more selective inhibitors than acyclic ones such as Vorinostat/ SAHA, which also inhibits some JmjC KDMs41. Our structure of 4 with JMJD5 implies stereoselective binding of a single enantiomer (the 3S-enantiomer) despite use of a racemic mixture for crystallisation. The structure of JMJD5 complexed with 4 reveals that its ring is snugly bound in the 2OG pocket making hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of W310, L329, which normally interact with the 2OG methylenes (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S8). The metal ion is coordinated by the N-hydroxy group oxygen (trans to H321) and one of the imide carboxyl oxygens (trans to D323).",

        "input": "BackgroundA facile and eco-friendly method for green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been developed using gum tragacanth (GT) (Astragalus gummifer), an abundantly available natural phyto-exudate in India, employing a novel method of ultrasonication process.MethodsSilver nanoparticles were prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate solution by the aqueous extract of gum tragacanth by ultrasonication method at 45 °C for about 45 min. The aqueous extract of the gum acts as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent.ResultsThe resultant AgNPs were characterized by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The influence of gum concentration and silver precursor concentration on the synthesis of AgNPs was studied. The role and effectiveness of nanoparticles in the catalytic reduction of a cationic dye methylene blue (MB), and an anionic azo dye Congo red (CR), were also studied. FTIR analysis revealed that –OH groups present in the gum matrix might be responsible for the reduction of Ag+ into AgNPs. The X-ray diffraction studies indicated that the resulting AgNPs were highly crystalline with face-centered cubic geometry. TEM studies showed that the average particle size of the synthesized AgNPs was 18 ± 2 nm.ConclusionsThe study highlights the green synthesis of GT-capped AgNPs and the rapid reduction of carcinogenic and toxic contaminants such as MB and CR with the help of GT-capped AgNPs in an eco-friendly manner.",

The electrons are readily accepted by the oxygen (O2) molecules to form superoxide radicals (O2·) which attack and promote the decolourization of RB dye molecules. Also, the holes generated in the 4d orbital and react with adsorbed H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH·) which attack the RB dye molecules. In addition to the decolourization of the dyes by the radicals, the holes generated in the 4d orbital of the Ag NPs capture electrons from the adsorbed dye molecule leading to further decolourization of the RB dye. These activated radical species (OH·, O2·) are responsible for RB decolourization and the generation of transitional products CO2, H2O.

Glucose led to vigorous growth (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Figure S4) and was used as a baseline to which all other substrates were compared. Similarly, the disaccharide cellobiose led to strong fungal growth, suggesting that anaerobic fungi readily produce β-glucosidases that can cleave cellobiose to glucose at a rate in excess of glucose uptake and metabolism (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Figure S4). In contrast, fungal growth on hemicellulosic components such as xylose (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Figure S4) led to inconsistent pressure accumulation and a significantly reduced growth rate relative to glucose (p = 0.0147, unpaired t test). Nonetheless, accumulation of fungal biomass on xylose was consistently observed (Additional file 1: Figure S5). Thus, xylose transport and incorporation into central metabolism likely occur more slowly than six carbon sugars and may be limiting for growth. Taken together, these results suggest that UH3-1 grows primarily on hexose sugars and has robust β-glucosidase activity that is not a bottleneck for biomass hydrolysis, unlike T. reesei .",

The temperature treatment of the SiO2:C powders results in the strong rise of the PL intensity and suppression of the Raman features. Just a small residue of the dominating feature at 1000 cm−1 is preserved in the sample annealed at 500 °C. A shift of the PL maximum towards the higher wavenumbers (relative), i.e., to longer wavelengths (on the absolute scale) is observed and it appears to agree with the results of . As the PL intensity increase with the increasing of the treatment temperature is rather dramatic, the Raman spectra intensity was normalized to its maximum value to make the spectra easily comparable. We did not observe any feature in annealed samples, which could be identified with the Raman spectrum of SiO2. It can be explained by the fact that SiO2 nanoparticles are completely coated by PMTS and the exciting light does not reach SiO2.",

In the current study, the oxLDL was obtained in our lab by copper-induced oxidation of native LDL (Fig. 1). By comparing the LDL particles before and after oxidation, we confirmed the oxidation-induced decrease in size of LDL particles (Fig. 2). It is well understood that oxidation (particularly copper-induced oxidation) generally leads to loss of LDL lipid components (e.g. peroxides, aldehydes, lyso-PC, etc.) and even protein components (e.g. hydrolysis or fragmentation of apolipoprotein B-100). For example, Fig. 1b shows that oxidation induced a dramatic malondialdehyde (MDA) production from LDL particles in an oxidation time-dependent manner. The oxidation-induced partial component loss of native LDL particles might be responsible for the significant decrease in size of oxLDL particles.",

Their accuracy heavily relies on the exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron–electron interaction beyond the classical model. As its universal form remains undiscovered, approximated functionals constructed with heuristic approaches are used for practical studies. However, there are problems in their accuracy and transferability, while any systematic approach to improve them is yet obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional can be systematically constructed using accurate density distributions and energies in reference molecules via machine learning. Surprisingly, a trial functional machine learned from only a few molecules is already applicable to hundreds of molecules comprising various first- and second-row elements with the same accuracy as the standard functionals. This is achieved by relating density and energy using a flexible feed-forward neural network, which allows us to take a functional derivative via the back-propagation algorithm. In addition, simply by introducing a nonlocal density descriptor, the nonlocal effect is included to improve accuracy, which has hitherto been impractical. Our approach thus will help enrich the DFT framework by utilizing the rapidly advancing machine-learning technique.",

In the straw hydrolysis assay, more reducing sugar was produced by the Δsxlr culture supernatant than by the parent strain. Compared with steam-exploded rice straw, higher straw hydrolysis was achieved by steam-exploded rice and corn straw mixture (Fig. 4d). This was probably because the hemi-cellulose content of corn straw was much higher than that of rice straw (41% vs 22%) . It has been suggested that the utilization of hemi-cellulose-rich substrate was significantly improved by the modified enzyme preparation. Because most TFs regulate cellulase and hemi-cellulase genes concurrently , the ratio of cellulase and hemi-cellulase is difficult to optimize by genetic manipulation of TFs. Our results shown that the appropriate proportion of the enzyme preparation can be conveniently optimized via engineering of sxlr. The derived strain would have a higher xylanase activity, while the cellulase activity would not be affected.",

SiO2-IMI were uniformly distributed into the hydrophobic SiO2 sol to construct “host”-“guest” feedback active coating with a superhydrophobic surface (SiO2-IMI@SHSC) on aluminium alloy, AA2024, by dip-coating technique. SiO2-IMI as “guest” components have good compatibility with “host” sol-gel coating, and more importantly, once localized corrosion occurs on the surface of AA2024, SiO2-IMI can simultaneously respond to the increase in environmental pH around corrosive micro-cathodic regions and decrease in pH near micro-anodic regions, promptly releasing HMID to form a compact molecular film on the damaged surface, inhibiting corrosion spread and executing a self-healing function. The scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) was applied to illustrate the suppression process of cathodic/anodic corrosion activities. Furthermore, benefiting from the superhydrophobic surface, SiO2-IMI@SHSC remained its protective ability after immersion in 0.5 M NaCl solution for 35 days, which is far superior to the conventional sol-gel coating with the same coating thickness. The facile fabrication method of SiO2-IMI simplifies the construction procedure of SiO2-IMI@SHSC, which have great potential to replace non-environmental chromate conversion coatings for practical use.",

The control strain S3S0 accumulated about 2.2-fold more ABA than MZ233. For S3S1 the ratio dropped to 1.4, indicating that MZ233 accumulates in this strain; whereas in S3S2, low amounts of MZ233 were produced, resulting in an ABA:MZ233 ratio of 7.2.

Such changes can be used to grasp and release nano-objects and move them across a surface199,200, a process, which is highly similar to the nanomechanical motion behaviors of natural systems. For example, Rühe and Santer201 covalently attached p(MMA-b-GMA) and p(BnMA-b-S) diblock-copolymer brushes onto the substrate surface. The mixed brushes showed obvious nanophase separation in a selective solvent, appearing in a ‘crater’’-like pattern. The pattern could be switched into a flat, featureless state by exposing the brushes to a solvent good for both blocks. Finally, such solvent-responsive behavior of diblock-copolymer brushes can be successfully used to drive appropriately nanosized particles across the surface (Fig. 19c). Yu et al.72 covalently attached nanoparticles onto the ends of PS-b-(PMMA-co-PCdMA) brushes, which could reversibly control the vertical, out-of-plane nanoparticle displacement after exposure to a selective solvent.",

On the one hand, ergosterol is essential to maintain a normal structure and function of cellular membranes , and ergosterol defect could also trigger redox imbalance . Therefore, besides ergosterol supplement, introducing cofactor regeneration modules and building gene genetic to restrict transcription of ERG5-6 only in cell growth stage would compensate for the necessary block of ergosterol biosynthesis during 7-DHC accumulation period. One the other hand, sterols stored in S. cerevisiae in their esterified forms, and overexpression of two endogenous sterol acyltransferases (ARE1 and ARE2) could promotes sterols accumulation . However, a DSM patent revealed that reducing or abolishing the activity of ARE1 or ARE2 was beneficial to 7-DHC production in yeast .

        "input": "BackgroundMedium chain length (C6–C12) α,ω-dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) and corresponding esters are important building blocks for the polymer industry. For DCAs of 12 carbon atoms and longer, a sustainable process based on monooxygenase catalyzed ω-oxidation of fatty-acids has been realized. For medium-chain DCAs with a shorter chain length however, such a process has not been developed yet, since monooxygenases poorly ω-oxidize medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs). On the contrary, esterified MCFAs are ω-oxidized well by the AlkBGTHJ proteins from Pseudomonas putida GPo1.ResultsWe show that MCFAs can be efficiently esterified and subsequently ω-oxidized in vivo. We combined ethyl ester synthesis and ω-oxidation in one-pot, whole-cell biocatalysis in Escherichia coli. Ethyl ester production was achieved by applying acyl-CoA ligase AlkK and an alcohol acyltransferase, either AtfA or Eeb1. E. coli expressing these proteins in combination with the ω-oxidation pathway consisting of AlkBGTHJ, produced mono-ethyl DCAs directly from C6, C8 and C9 fatty acids. The highest molar yield was 0.75, for mono-ethyl azelate production from nonanoic acid. Furthermore, di-ethyl esters were produced. Diethyl suberate was produced most among the di-ethyl esters, with a molar yield of 0.24 from octanoic acid.ConclusionThe results indicate that esterification of MCFAs and subsequent ω-oxidation to mono-ethyl DCAs via whole-cell biocatalysis is possible. This process could be the first step towards sustainable production of medium-chain DCAs and medium-chain di-ethyl esters.",

The polymer matrix can prevent solid-state quenching and also provide sufficient mechanical strength and catalytic stability and facilitate application with easy separation. Such polymer/CD nanocomposite systems have found use in opto-electrical applications. Photo-catalytic applications have also been reported recently . In this regard, we found that the waterborne hyperbranched polyurethane (WPU) system is attractive as a polymer support. The solubility of both the nanomaterial and polymer in the same medium (aqueous) expedites homogeneous distribution of the CDs over the polymer matrix, thereby preserving their photo-harvesting ability. Further, the use of WPU offers additional advantages. During the polymerization reaction, WPU becomes soluble due to the creation of ionic centers along the polymer chains. Thus, it behaves like an ionomer with electron transfer capability. Hence, compared to conventional polymeric systems, WPU is expected to act as a better catalyst support for photo-catalytic reactions.",

The mechanochemical route removes these constraints. It was proven that iron from steel balls can react with the sulfur polymer to form inorganic sections anchoring the polymers. The obtained polymers were demonstrated to show many modified properties such as high solvent resistance and high mercury uptake efficiency and capacity. The synthetic materials also show good processing ability which might be used to broaden applications not limited to UV-induced self-healing.

After a 10 min addition of the MHb–ART complex to 10 mM GSH, a typical DMPO-OH adduct spectrum was detected, implying that the hydroxyl radical (•OH) was generated from the MHb–ART complex by adding GSH. After 1 h addition of the MHb–ART complex to 10 mM GSH, the EPR spectrum changed dramatically with the signal, mainly due to the DMPO adduct of carbon-centered free radicals (Supplementary Figure S5).

        "input": "To get insight on the carrier transfer process, the steady-state PL spectra for the MAPbI3 films with and without tin-doped PQDs were measured. As shown in Fig. 7d, the PL peak intensity at about 775 nm was obviously decreased after the incorporation of CsSn0.1Pb0.9I3 QDs or CsSn0.2Pb0.8I3 QDs. There are two explanations for the weakening of PL intensity: First, the PQDs cause additional non-radiative pathways to capture photogenerated carriers; second, the higher VB edge of PQDs allows more photogenerated holes to migrate to the PQD layer; thus, the number of carriers participating in direct recombination is reduced.

Unlike the aforementioned two types of catalysts, the redox active transition metal catalysts are able to transform reactive radical species into relatively stable polar species, thus partially alleviating the enantiocontrol challenge. For example, in the classic enantioselective Kharasch–Sosnovsky reaction (Fig. 6a)61, the trap of prochiral allylic radicals with chiral Cu(II) complexes leads to formation of chiral Cu(III) species, of which subsequent reductive elimination via a pericyclic rearrangement process delivers the enantioenriched allyl esters. A range of chiral ligands61–63, mainly oxazoline-based ones, have been developed for high enantioselectivity. Nonetheless, the substrate scope has been largely limited to simple cyclic alkenes so far.Fig. 6Examples of enantiocontrol by chiral transition metal catalysts in enantioselective C(sp3)–H functionalization.a Enantiocontrol in enantioselective Kharasch–Sosnovsky allylic C(sp3)–H acyloxylation catalyzed by chiral copper complexes. b Enantiocontrol in enantioselective benzylic C(sp3)–H cyanation catalyzed by copper/chiral box complexes. c Enantiocontrol in enantioselective tertiary benzylic C(sp3)–H amination by copper/chiral phosphoric acid dual catalysis. d Structures of typical chiral transition metal catalysts employed in relevant works.

Although detailed mutation cases could not be clarified in the abovementioned mutant strain XC-11G, the productivity of CRM A is completely activated as a titer of 42.51 ± 4.22 mg/L. This upregulation of gene expression was due to the gentamycin-induced mutation similar to that of antibiotics used in ribosome engineering . Maybe, mutation of the translation apparatus attacked by gentamycin was repaired in subsequent cultivation, which remained upregulated gene expression and drug resistance. These results unambiguously validated the feasibility and efficiency of gentamycin-induced ribosome engineering, even if its detailed mechanism needed to be further investigated.",

        "input": "For two-step reactions, the rate constant of product formation is computed in both dry and wet media (see Tables S9 and S10). For P4 generation, the ratio of rate constant in the presence and absence of a water molecule kP4-1WHA/k4 (kP4-1WTA/k4) is 3.35E−02 (2.66E+01), 8.23E−03 (4.72E−02), and 8.68E−02 (3.02E−03) at 300, 1500, and 3000 K, respectively. These results demonstrate that the same as other paths the product formation through 1WHA formation has a lower rate constant at low temperatures. Regarding the ratio kP5-1WHA/k5, the results indicate that these ratios are smaller than others at low temperatures. The obtained value for kP5-1WHA/k5 is 3.61E−03, 3.99E−03, 7.11E−02 and at 300, 400, and 500 K, respectively. But, for kP5-1WTB/k5 the same values are 1.97E+02, 1.52E−01 and 3.03E+00, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that there is a remarkable difference in the computed rate constants of a product formation in wet media due to the orientation of the water molecule. Also, there is a meaningful difference between the computed rate constants of the argued paths in wet and dry media because of a change in barrier energy over the 300–3000 K temperature range.",

Among the conducting polymers, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) abbreviated hereafter as PEDOT is of particular interest owing to its remarkable optical, electrical, and electrochemical properties. To obtain PEDOT-based films deposited on almost any surfaces (e.g., conductive or dielectric, flexible, and polymeric), aqueous dispersion of polymeric complex of PEDOT doped by poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) is often used. A polymeric anion PSS acts simultaneously as an acid dopant and an anionic surfactant which stabilizes the dispersion of the polymer . High enough processing ability and conductivity of the polymer complex PEDOT:PSS make it one of the most promising conducting polymers. Recently, it has been shown that adsorption of gas molecules such as CO  and NH3 , as well as vapors of organic solvents  or water molecules , can strongly affect different physical characteristics of PEDOT:PSS and the relevant composites.

Here a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of single water molecule on vanadium clusters Vn+ (3 ≤ n ≤ 30) is observed in the reaction of cationic vanadium clusters with water at room temperature. The combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the wagging vibrations of a V-OH group give rise to readily formed V-O-V intermediate states on Vn+ (n ≥ 3) clusters and allow the terminal hydrogen to interact with an adsorbed hydrogen atom, enabling hydrogen release. The presence of three metal atoms reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, giving rise to an effective production of hydrogen from single water molecules. This mechanism differs from dissociative chemisorption of multiple water molecules on aluminium cluster anions, which usually proceeds by dissociative chemisorption of at least two water molecules at multiple surface sites followed by a recombination of the adsorbed hydrogen atoms.",

The results indicated that no obvious enhancement in lipid productivity could be observed in the first 72 h, because the biomass concentration and lipid content remained at a relatively low level. After 72 h of cultivation time, due to evident biomass accumulation under light cycles and lipid production under dark cycles, lipid productivity increased continually, reaching a maximum of 182.6 mg L−1 day−1 at 166 h of cultivation.

Many optical telecommunication devices use the Faraday effect — a means of rotating the polarization of light using magnetic fields — to prevent unwanted light transmissions. Now, Yasuchika Hasegawa from Hokkaido University in Japan and co-workers have observed the first-ever correlation between the Faraday effect and molecular chirality. The Faraday effect is traditionally viewed as being insensitive to natural optical activity such as chirality. But the team's previous investigations, which showed organic ligands influenced promising Faraday materials known as terbium glasses, inspired them to challenge long-held assumptions. They synthesized nine-membered terbium clusters and complexed them with chiral salicylate ligands. Different ligand chirality categorically affected the Faraday rotation angles — an effect that may arise from terbium's large transition magnetic dipole.",

The input to the SVM is the MS/MS spectrum along with the corresponding computed fragmentation tree. CSI:FingerID has shown superior performance when compared to other existing tools for the automatic identification of molecular structures from spectra data. In particular, it was the best-performing method in the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) contest for 2016 and 201731.

The study furthermore showed that FvPPT1 from F. verticillioides was the most efficient PPTase partner for heterologously expressing these two biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae and the production of PKS can thus be increased through utilization of pathway-specific PPTases. Most importantly, the study elucidated that the optimal combination of PKS and PPTase can increase production of target polyketide up to two-fold, compared to the most widely applied PPTases in heterologous expression systems.",

In addition, phosphate acetyltransferase (pta) and pyruvate oxidase (poxB) in the acetate synthesis pathway were up-regulated by 2.39- and 4.17-fold in ‘B’. Organic nitrogen sources provided more proteins and amino acids for biomass synthesis, and the carbon in the yeast extract and tryptone could also be absorbed and enter TCA cycle.

This shows that one cannot rely solely on artificial substrates to characterize the positional preference of acetyl esterases, and that natural substrates are required as well. Both the initial deacetylation rates and the final deacetylation efficiency on differently acetylated, plant-derived Xylp residues are required to characterize the acetyl esterases from different CE families.

The existence of a VC phase with long-range ordered chiralities as a precursor of spin order is the most plausible explanation. Hence, our results provide the long-sought experimental proof of the theoretically predicted existence of a VC phase, in close analogy to cholesteric liquid crystals12 via polarization measurements. We confirm the expectation that spin chirality without long-range spin order occurs prior to 3D spin-spiral order.13 We demonstrate that the spin twist in a VC phase induces ferroelectricity, just as in conventional spin-spiral magnets, however, with much lower polarisation. It would be highly interesting to perform neutron-scattering experiments on LiCuVO4 in applied magnetic fields H||c, specifically focusing on the occurrence of this VC state.",

        "input": "To enhance the gasoline octane number, low-octane linear n-alkanes should be converted into their high-octane di-branched isomers via n-alkane hydroisomerization. Therefore, hierarchical SAPO-11-based catalysts are prepared by adding different contents of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), and they are applied in n-nonane hydroisomerization. When n(SDBS)/n(SiO2) is less than or equal to 0.125, the synthesized hierarchical molecular sieves are all pure SAPO-11, and as the SDBS content increases, the submicron particle size decreases, and the external surface area (ESA) increases. Additionally, these hierarchical SAPO-11 have smaller submicron particles and higher ESA values than conventional SAPO-11. When n(SDBS)/n(SiO2) is greater than 0.125, with increasing SDBS content (n(SDBS)/n(SiO2) = 0.25), the synthesized SAPO-11 contains amorphous materials, which leads to a decline in the ESA; with the further increase in SDBS content (n(SDBS)/n(SiO2) = 0.5), the products are all amorphous materials. These results indicate that in the case of n(SDBS)/n(SiO2) = 0.125, the synthesized SAPO-11 molecular sieve (S–S3) has the most external Brønsted acid centers and the highest ESA of these SAPO-11, and these advantages favor generation of the di-branched isomers in hydrocarbon hydroisomerization. Among these Pt/SAPO-11 catalysts, Pt/S–S3 displays the highest selectivity to entire isomers (83.4%), the highest selectivity to di-branched isomers (28.1%) and the minimum hydrocracking selectivity (15.7%) in n-nonane hydroisomerization.",

Surfactant has been shown to impact the surface properties of microparticles, such as morphology  and surface hydrophobicity . Additionally, if rinsing is insufficient, the traces of surfactant on microparticles can damage the devices during application. In this situation, microparticles should be prepared without surfactant, which is possible with droplet-based microfluidics. In the microchannel, the coalescence of droplets can be avoided by enlarging the distance between droplets, which can be achieved by regulating flow rates. Furthermore, gelation, either on-chip or off-chip, solidifies droplets and thus helps to avoid coalescence as well. Another strategy consists of using partially miscible fluids. This means that the droplets shrink and become more and more condensed during passage through the channel. At the outlet, either gelation  or a final shrinkage  can help avoid coalescence.",

        "input": "In this work, the attapulgite (ATP) was used as a promising mineral clay to prepare polyamide 12 (PA12) matrix polymer nanocomposites. ATP has a relatively low cost compared to other nanoclays and is a very abundant raw material in the northeast region of Brazil. The ATP was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM). The PA12/ATP nanocomposites with 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 wt% of ATP were prepared using a simple blending method in a high-speed thermokinetic homogenizer (3000 rpm) in which the melting of the PA12 and the mixture with ATP occurred by friction, followed by hot pressing and stamping of the specimens. The nanocomposites were characterized by mechanical properties, the degree of crystallinity and crystallite size were calculated by XRD, and the morphological characteristics were observed by SEM. The addition of ATP in the PA12 matrix increased the modulus of elasticity, hardness, degree of crystallinity and the apparent crystallite size of the nanocomposites. The addition of up to 5 wt% of ATP increased tensile strength and deformation at break; for higher concentrations, the dispersion was not efficient. A major advantage of using ATP as a reinforcement agent for PA12 is the low cost of this material plus the great interaction with PA12 which can dispense the use of compatibilizer agents and/or surface modification in the ATP, making it a potential material to extend PA12’s range of applications.",

The lifetime of such clusters is dependent on the composition of the melt, its temperature and the applied electric field strength, but remains in the ps-timescale. The formation of those clusters agrees with the lighter anions drifting in the same direction as the Li+ cation on average in an electric field.

The results showed that the effect of laser irradiation on the distribution size was more on the size of particles.

Combining the polarization-selective forward trans-to-cis photoisomerization and the unselective backward cis-to-trans photoisomerization, the number of ACzEs with their transition moments normal to the light polarization direction gradually increases, resulting in light-selective alignment, with the transition moments of the ACzEs almost perpendicular to the polarization direction of the actinic light. Through these processes, the photoalignment and subsequent reorientation of ACzE occurs quickly, which changes the refractive index.

The P(3H2MB) and P(3HB) polymers that were melted at 220 °C for 1 min were quenched to Tiso, after which homogeneous and sporadic crystallization was observed. The spherulites appeared in the molten state. Because the spherulites of P(3H2MB) appeared at temperatures above 140 °C, crystallization of P(3H2MB) started before the sample temperature reached Tiso when Tiso was below 140 °C. In contrast, spherulites of P(3HB) did not appear before the sample temperature reached Tiso. The radial growth rate of spherulites (G) was determined from the temporal increase in the spherulite size at a given Tiso. The G value of P(3H2MB) was determined to be 0.91 µm/s at Tiso = 140 °C, and the spherulites of P(3HB) grew at a rate of 3.4 μm/s at Tiso = 100 °C.

Here we use broadband ultrafast optical spectroscopy to track charge transfer dynamics in large-area 2D heterostructures made of epitaxial single-layer tungsten disulfide (WS2) grown by chemical vapour deposition on graphene. Selective carrier photoexcitation in graphene, with tunable near-infrared photon energies as low as 0.8 eV (i.e. lower than half of the optical bandgap of WS2), results in an almost instantaneous bleaching of the WS2 excitonic peaks in the visible range, due to the interlayer charge transfer process. We find that the charge transfer signal is strongly non-linear with the pump fluence and it becomes progressively more linear at increasing pump photon energies, while the interlayer photoinjection rate is constant in energy, reflecting the spectrally flat absorbance of graphene. We ascribe the interlayer charge transfer to a fast transfer of hot carriers, photogenerated in graphene, to the semiconducting layer. The measured sub-20-fs hot-carrier transfer sets the ultimate timescale for this process. Besides their fundamental interest, our results are technologically relevant because, given the capability of large-area deterministic growth of the heterostructure, they open up promising paths for novel 2D photodetectors, also potentially scalable to industrial platforms.",

Studies report a closed active site in C-terminal trans-peptidase domain, that substrate could not freely gain access to the active site and can explain bacteria resistance to antibiotic. PBP2a efficaciously recognises -lactam antibiotics as possible inhibitors, prefers the peptidoglycan substrate, and carries out the peptidoglycan-crosslinking process under physiological conditions . β-lactams connect either particularly to the active site (covalently)  or to both the allosteric (non-covalent) and the active sites (covalent) . An allosteric site in a non-penicillin-binding domain, distal from the active site is responsible to discriminate when properly occupied simultaneously opens the gatekeeper residues (Met641 and Tyr446) within the active site.

However, ruthenium and several materials used in these cells are toxic and relatively expensive because they have a low natural abundance. They offer a promising alternative to conventional and expensive silicon-based solar cells . Electrical energy is generated when they are exposed to light. Electrons in dye molecules are excited and then injected into a semiconductor photoelectrode (TiO2, ZnO, WO, etc.) conduction band, where dye molecules adsorb. These electrons migrate through the host semiconductor particles until they reach the collector, then the holes simultaneously generated are reduced by a redox electrolyte or hole carrier at the counter-electrode (Pt, carbon, etc.). This cycle is well regenerative since no substance has been consumed or produced during the process. However, some reactions may occur and cause a significant decrease in the effectiveness of the DSSCs. They are the recombination of the electrons injected either with the oxidized sensitizer or with the oxidized redox couple on the surface of photoelectrode .",

The combined effects of these processes on marine planktic calcifiers at decadal to centennial timescales are poorly understood. Here, we analyze size normalized planktic foraminiferal shell weight, shell geochemistry, and supporting proxies from 3 sediment cores in the Mediterranean Sea spanning several centuries. Our results allow us to investigate the response of surface-dwelling planktic foraminifera to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. We find that increased anthropogenic carbon dioxide levels led to basin wide reductions in size normalized weights by modulating foraminiferal calcification. Carbon (δ13C) and boron (δ11B) isotopic compositions also indicate the increasing influence of fossil fuel derived carbon dioxide and decreasing pH, respectively. Alkenone concentrations and test accumulation rates indicate that warming and changes in biological productivity are insufficient to offset acidification effects.

        "input": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of tryptophan (Trp) on the production of total phenolic compounds (TP) in the mycelial culture of Ganoderma neo-japonicum (G. neo-japonicum). Among various amino acids tested, Trp was best for increasing the TP content by 13.2-fold compared to the control. Trp also increased the phenylalanine content via Trp-specific activation of chorismate mutase. Although 12 mM of Trp was the optimal concentration for TP production, it significantly inhibited mycelial growth. This growth inhibition was reversed by the addition of yeast extract (YE) in a dose-dependent manner. Consequently the combined addition of Trp (12 mM) and YE (8 g/L) stimulated TP production up to 73.5 mg gallic acid equivalent per g dry weight of mycelial culture. Furthermore, the phenolic profiling revealed that quercertin occupied 34.1% of the total amount of phenolic compounds tested and the resveratrol concentration increased at the highest rate (49.1-fold) compared to that of the control. These results provided strong evidence that the accumulation of phenolic compounds in the G. neo-japonicum mycelia was regulated by the availability of substrates involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway, which may be useful in regulation and optimization of G. neo-japonicum culture for efficient production of valuable nutraceuticals.",

First, linear reactions which contribute to extending the macromolecule by coupling new monomer units with β-O-4, β–β and β-5 linkages to form monomer-monomer and oligomer-monomer couplings. Second, branching reactions that form oligomer-oligomer couplings with 5-5 and 4-O-5 linkages3,26,30,35. It is important to note that units with 5-5 linkage have an alternate form with an 8-member ring structure named dibenzodioxocin (DBDO)36,37 which is predominantly present in softwood lignin. Spirodienone (β-1′/α-O-α′) has also been reported as a possible linkage with low prevalence (~3–4 in 100 phenylpropanoid units)3,38.",

These metabolic capacities of G14 make the previously-observed sulfite stimulated growth of C. phenolicus plausible . Notably, G14 encodes three complete sets of ABC-type transport systems for sulfonate (Additional file 1: Table S6), a substrate utilizable by its sulfite-reducing Desulfitobacterium relatives as a terminal electron acceptor (TEA) for growth . Nevertheless, to ascertain whether G14 assimilates sulfonate is impossible merely by reference-based genome annotation, because the enzymes responsible for sulfonate assimilation in Firmicutes remain unknown. Assuming that the ABC-type sulfonate transport system, sulfite reductases, and hypothetical proteins of G14 enable its uptake of sulfonate, phenol/4-OHB may also be degraded via sulfonate respiration. Future studies are needed to test whether sulfonate supports growth of Cryptanaerobacter species and which enzymes will be expressed by Desulfitobacterium isolates to utilize (aliphatic) sulfonate as TEA for growth with the release of sulfonate sulfur as sulfide.",

This effect of ion migration is also more dominant along the grain boundaries and interfaces than in the bulk film35. Furthermore, the existence of shallow electronic traps arising from ionic vacancies in perovskites carries the risk of transforming into deep traps upon interaction with moisture and oxygen. Because the absorption of water and oxygen molecules at these vacant sites is significantly more favorable than on pristine surfaces, perovskite degradation is accelerated through the vacancy-assisted decomposition mechanism36.

It thus becomes imperative to explore new approaches to enhance biological fibers’ stability and environmental tolerance and to impart them with diverse functionalities, such as mechanical recoverability and stimulus-triggered responses. Herein, we develop a dynamic imine fiber chemistry (DIFC) approach to engineer molecular interactions to fabricate strong and tough protein fibers with recoverability and actuating behaviors. The resulting DIF fibers exhibit extraordinary mechanical performances, outperforming many recombinant silks and synthetic polymer fibers. Remarkably, impaired DIF fibers caused by fatigue or strong acid treatment are quickly recovered in water directed by the DIFC strategy. Reproducible mechanical performance is thus observed. The DIF fibers also exhibit exotic mechanical stability at extreme temperatures (e.g., −196 °C and 150 °C). When triggered by humidity, the DIFC endows the protein fibers with diverse actuation behaviors, such as self-folding, self-stretching, and self-contracting. Therefore, the established DIFC represents an alternative strategy to strengthen biological fibers and may pave the way for their high-tech applications.",

        "input": "We report that vertically aligned molybdenum (Mo) nanowalls can grow on various substrates by simple thermal vapor deposition. Individual nanowalls have a typical thickness of about 50 nm and very good conductivity with a typical average value of about 1.97 × 104 Ω−1 cm−1, i.e., only an order of magnitude less than the value of bulk Mo. The formation process is characterized in detail, and it is found that Mo nanowalls grow from nanorods through nanotrees. The atomic arrangement, lattice mismatch relationship, and competition growth are all believed to contribute to the growth mechanism. The field emission performance is attractive, typically with a very low fluctuation of about approximately 1.18% at a high current density level of 10 mA/cm2, and a sustainably stable very large current density of approximately 57.5 mA/cm2 was recorded. These indicate that the Mo nanowall is a potential candidate as a cold cathode for application in vacuum electron devices, which demand both a high current and high current density.",

The feasibility of using two CAAC ligands by modifying anchors to control both the E- and Z-selectivity of hydrogenation enhances the potential effect of this strategy. With the environmental and cost benefits that catalytic hydrogenation brings to chemical synthesis, these ligand-controllable and stereo-complementary approaches enable the large-scale, sustainable, and selective H2-hydrogenation of simple alkynes to produce on-demand valuable sets of E- and Z-olefins in high efficiency. This is particularly relevant to cases where there are electronic and steric differences between the two CAAC ligand anchors66–69. The methods described above are expected to lead to the design of robust metal catalysts for developing ligand-controlled selective reactions in the efficient construction of industrially important chemicals.",

Additionally, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the robust mutant were lower than that in the WT under methanol induction conditions. To figure out the difference of cellular response to methanol between the WT and the robust mutant, RNA-seq was detected and compared. The results of RNA-seq showed that the expression levels of genes related to antioxidant, MAPK pathway, ergosterol synthesis pathway, transcription factors, and the peroxisome pathway were upregulated in the robust mutant compared to the WT. The upregulation of these key pathways can improve the oxidative stress tolerance of strains and efficiently eliminate cellular ROS. Hence, we inferred that the high heterologous protein expression efficiency in the robust mutant may be due to its enhanced oxidative stress tolerance. Promisingly, we have indeed increased the expression level of lipase up to 1.6-fold by overexpressing antioxidant genes in P. pastoris.",

Further analysis showed that Avicel could specifically induce cellulase expression, which supported the existence of an unknown specific regulator of cellulases in strain NJAU4742. The xylanase secretion is very complex, GH10 endoxylanases could only be induced by Avicel, while, other major xylanases were significantly induced by both Avicel and xylan. For GH10 xylanases, an unknown specific regulator was also deduced to exist. Meanwhile, the post-transcriptional inhibition was subsequently suggested to stop the Avicel-induced xylanases secretion, which explained the specifically high xylanase activities when induced by xylan in strain NJAU4742. Additionally, an economical strategy used by strain NJAU4742 was proposed to sense the environmental lignocellulose under the carbon starvation condition, that only slightly activating 4 lignocellulose-degrading genes before largely secreting all 33 TgXyr1-controlled lignocellulases if confirming the existence of lignocellulose components.ConclusionsThis study, aiming to explore the unknown mechanisms of plant biomass-degrading enzymes regulation through the combined omics analysis, will open directions for in-depth understanding the complex carbon utilization in filamentous fungi.",

By demonstrating highly sensitive quantitative mappings of a small amount of isomer impurities (i.e., β-lactose) in the anomer mixture, we also show the promise of our THz s-SNOM technical platform for trace analysis of impurities in organic crystals, particularly isomer and polymorphic impurities in organic semiconducting materials, which critically impact the performance of organic thin-film transistors29.",

Though no appreciable crystal degradation was observed in the X-ray tests, a steady increase in the ES nitrito-ONO isomer occupancy was measured with increasing exposure time. This X-ray induced excitation could be limited by increasing the attenuation of the synchrotron beam, leading us to select a 5% beam intensity for experiments, which produced a baseline X-ray excitation of c.a. 3% in testing. LED exposure tests revealed that prolonged irradiation for c.a. 4 h led to irreversible damage at the crystal surface, causing a visible colour change from pale-yellow to orange, alongside gradual photobleaching with time (Supplementary Information, Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. S7).

        "input": "BackgroundA raw starch-degrading α-amylase from Pontibacillus sp. ZY (AmyZ1), previously screened by our laboratory, showed a promising application potential for starch-processing industries. However, the AmyZ1 secretory production still under investigation, which seriously restricts its application in the starch-processing industry. On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis is widely used to achieve the extracellular expression of target proteins.ResultsAmyZ1 secretory production was achieved in B. subtilis and was enhanced by promoter engineering and translation initiation efficiency optimization. First, based on the different phase-dependent promoters, the dual-promoter PspoVG–PspoVG142 was constructed by combining dual-promoter engineering and promoter modification. The corresponding strain BZd34 showed an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 1437.6 U/mL during shake flask cultivation, which was 3.11-fold higher than that of the original strain BZ1 (PgroE). Then, based on translation initiation efficiency optimization, the best strain BZd343 containing optimized 5'-proximal coding sequence (opt3) produced the highest extracellular α-amylase activity of 1691.1 U/mL, which was 3.65-fold higher than that of the strain BZ1. Finally, cultivation of BZd343 in 3-L fermenter exhibited an extracellular AmyZ1 activity of 14,012 U/mL at 48 h, with productivity of 291.9 U/mL·h.ConclusionsThis is the first report of recombinant expression of AmyZ1 in B. subtilis and the expression level of AmyZ1 represents the highest raw starch-degrading α-amylase level in B. subtilis to date. The high-level expression of AmyZ1 in this work provides a foundation for its industrial production. The strategies used in this study also provide a strategic reference for improving the secretory expression of other enzymes in B. subtilis.",

To test this, we measured the levels of phenolic compounds and mitochondrial respiration rates in phytoplankton in monospecific laboratory cultures and in mixed phytoplankton assemblages, grown under different levels of CO2. Subsequently, zooplankton assemblages were fed with phytoplankton cells grown under the elevated CO2 concentration to examine possible food chain effects.

It is known that due to the presence of this oil fraction, it contains not only aromatic hydrocarbons but also non-reactive aliphatic hydrocarbons. Of course, when RPF is divided into narrower fractions (RFB, RFT, RFX), they also contain other non-reactive hydrocarbons. Therefore, compared to pure individual hydrocarbons, the yield is reduced in this case. However, when RPF is used directly, it has a synergistic effect due to the presence of various aromatic hydrocarbons, and the yield of AP increases. The yield of AP increases up to 80%. Therefore, economically and ecologically, it is more acceptable to use RPF directly. Our main goal is to use RPF directly, too. Furthermore, because of less viscosity and flowing ability, the use of the TEAHX IL leads to an increase in the yield of AP impressively compared to the PHX IL. But high viscosity of PHX influences to the diffusion factor in alkylation processes.",

An artificial SEI could prevent cathode pulverization, and a 3D skeleton could improve electrode–electrolyte wettability.

The crystallization of the different polymorphs is a rather complex process. Polymorphs R, Y, ON, OP, YN, and ORP were obtained by solution crystallization, and RPL by vapor deposition on single-crystal substrates38,46,48. Near room temperature, ROY was found to crystallize spontaneously into YN, Y04, ON, and R0546,48,49. YT04 was identified after a solid-solid transition of the metastable polymorph Y0438,49, while other several cross-nucleation processes were also described38,46,50.

Many studies in recent years have been aimed at finding simple and reliable methods using non-toxic chelating compounds. The search for natural non-toxic compounds is therefore of great relevance, especially in the conservation of cultural heritage, where the use of toxic chemical compounds often involves risks for the environment and human health. Following this trend, the purpose of this preliminary work was to verify the use of two proteins, Lactotransferrin (Ltf) and Ovotransferrin (Ovt), for the removal of iron-based stains on marble surfaces. The two proteins, whose high affinity for iron “in vivo” has been widely documented, were extracted from their natural matrices. The protein extracts were then immobilized using a common cellulose pulp. The poultices obtained were spread on the surfaces of artificially stained marble specimens and, after a set time, were easily removed. The effectiveness of the removal, visually evident, was detected by spectrocolorimetry and image analysis. The surface analyses, before and after the treatment, carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirmed that both proteins have a selective and effective complexing capacity for the ferric ions of rust stains.",

In the first step, 30.1 g L-1 of acetoin, the precursor of TMP, was biosynthesized in 29 h from 100 g L-1 of glucose by Bacillus subtilis CICC 10211 in a fermentor controlled at 37°C, pH 7.0 ± 0.2, 500 rpm of stirring, and 1.0 vvm of airflow. In the following step, the fermentation broth, supplemented with 67.7 g L-1 of diammonium phosphate, was transferred into another reactor controlled at 95°C. After 2.5 h of spontaneous reaction, 8.34 g L-1 of TMP was obtained. A temporary by-product, which was identified as 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2,4,5-trimethyl-3-oxazoline, was formed but then decomposed rapidly under higher temperature. The novel method received consistent results when it was tested using Serratia marcescens CICC 10187 and Paenibacillus polymyxa CICC 23617, respectively. Crystallized TMP with high purity (99.9%) from the cooled reaction mixture was harvested by filtration.ConclusionsThe novel method can be expanded for other acetoin-producing strains and it gives the highest product titre and production efficiency so far devised for TMP production from renewable materials. The complex components of the reaction mixture have no effect on the purity of the product obtained from the crystallization process.",

While it is unlikely that resorption occurred as early as on day 2, as osteoclasts were not observed on the coated membrane even after 7 days (Fig. 2), it is plausible that the higher Ca2+ content in differentiation medium at 9 and 16 days was due to resorption of the substrate.

They found critical biaxial strains at which the Pockels response diverged and specific phonon modes went soft. Hamze and Demkov18 studied the same phenomenon in strained SrTiO3 (STO), and through the analyses of mode Grüneisen parameters related anharmonicity (soft modes) to an emergent EO response35,36. Paillard et al.20 reported similar behavior in the EO response of strained PbTiO3 (PTO). These crystals all have in common soft phonons and large crystal anharmonicity. A 1-D anharmonic oscillator model of the Pockels effect37 shows the Pockels parameter is directly proportional to the coefficient of the anharmonic force term, reinforcing the assumed relationship between anharmonicity and the EO response. Noticing that, in these materials, the Pockels effect is dominated by the lattice, the appropriate figure of merit is the ratio of the Raman susceptibility and square of the phonon frequency. One may therefore infer the following design rule: highly anharmonic, noncentrosymmetric crystals should exhibit a large Pockels effect.",

We also propose a particle size prediction mechanism to regulate the size of vapor-condensed agglomerated nanoparticles in these structures. Size characterization studies performed on the agglomerated nanoparticles of fabricated 3-D structures showed that the size distributions vary with the fluence-to-threshold ratio. The variation in laser parameters leads to varying plume temperature, pressure, amount of supersaturation, nucleation rate, and the growth rate of particles in the plume. The novel wafer-foil ablation technique could promote the possibilities of fabricating oxide nanostructures with varying Al/Si ratio, and the crystallinity of these structures enhances possible applications. The fabricated nanostructures of Al and Si oxides could have great potentials to be used in the fabrication of low power-consuming complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor circuits and in Mn catalysts to enhance the efficiency of oxidation on ethylbenzene to acetophenone in the super-critical carbon dioxide.",

In this work, natural HAp that was extracted from chicken bone wastes is used as support matrix for the deposition of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to produce HAp/AgNPs nanocomposite. XRD, FESEM-EDX, HRTEM, and XPS analyses confirmed that spherical AgNPs were successfully synthesized and deposited on the surface of HAp particles, and the amount of AgNPs adhered on the HAp surface increased with increasing AgNO3 concentration used. The synthesized HAp/AgNPs nanocomposites demonstrated strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, where the antibacterial efficiency is relied on the amount and size of deposited AgNPs. In addition, the in vitro bioactivity examination in Hank’s balanced salt solution showed that more apatite were grown on the surface of HAp/AgNPs nanocomposite when AgNO3 concentration used >1 wt.%. Such nanocomposite with enhanced bioactivity and antibacterial properties emerged as a promising biomaterial to be applied for dentistry and orthopedic implantology.",

Extracellular acetate accumulation was reduced and cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool was enhanced through the deletion of YPL062W. A novel and optimal combination of CrtE, CrtB and CrtI was obtained by screening enzymes from diverse sources. It was also found that CrtI from B. trispora had significant influence on lycopene yield as well as proportion in carotenoid. The proportion of lycopene was significantly increased via fine-tuning of CrtI. Then the effects of cell mating types, several potential distant targets (YJL064 W, ROX1, and DOS2), and INO2, a stress-related transcription factor, were also investigated. Lycopene yield was stepwise improved by approximately 22-fold as compared to the starting strain. The highest reported lycopene yield (55.56 mg/g DCW) and titer (1.65 g/L) were achieved in 5-L bioreactors, providing a good example for microbial overproduction of pharmaceutical and chemical products through combinatorial engineering of host cell and heterologous pathway.",

However, there remains a substantial challenge to produce long-standing radicals by light, because of the structural dilemmas between photoproduction and stabilization. Herein, we present a pyrrole and chloride assisted photochromic structure to address this issue. In this well-selected system, production and stabilization of a radical species were simultaneously found accompanied by a photochemical process in chloroform. Theoretical study and mechanism construction indicate that the designed π-system provides a superior spin-delocalization effect and a large steric effect, mostly avoiding possible consumptions and making the radical stable for hours even under an oxygen-saturated condition. Moreover, this radical system can be applied for a visualized and quantitative detection towards peroxides, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone. As the detection relies on a radical capturing mechanism, a higher sensing rate was achieved compared to traditional redox techniques for peroxide detection.",

Understanding these dynamics is essential given that OA threatens many goods and services provided by coastal ecosystems11. Despite representing only a small fraction of the ocean (~7% is shallower than 200 m), coastal ecosystems contribute disproportionately to marine primary production (~25% of the ocean total) and fisheries catch (~90%)12,13. Coastal systems are also disproportionately impacted by humans as the majority of the world’s population lives within 100 km of coastlines14.

Thin shells were found in coastal waters of the CCE with high pCO2, low pH and aragonite saturation levels approaching undersaturated conditions (ΩAr = 1.08), whereas thick shells were found in offshore stations that were supersaturated with aragonite (ΩAr up to 1.79). Pteropods are likely to produce less shell material if the major substrate (carbonate) required for shell formation is in short supply. This is in agreement with numerous experimental studies, showing that acidified conditions reduce calcification16,18–20, as well as in situ measurements using calcein-stained shells17, and a synthesis study showing that pteropod calcification was negatively affected when ΩAr is below 1.235. The 37% decline in shell thickness along the upwelling gradient of our study exceeds the 25% decline in shell thickness over the past ~ 100 years reported for Styliola subula from the Mediterranean Sea, where waters are still super-saturated with respect to aragonite26.",

This shift was caused by properties of chitosan. Chitosan is a cationic polymer, with pKa ~6.5, which is insoluble in water at neutral pH, at which the majority of amines from the molecule are deprotonated. On the other hand, at acidic pH, the chitosan becomes water soluble, as it is positively charged . The creation of ZnS-chitosan colloidal system brought about the increased stability of the suspension from incipient instability area to good stability area (up to +57 mV at pH 3).

        "input": "Background3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is an important chemical precursor for the production of bioplastics. Microbial production of 3HP from glycerol has previously been developed through the optimization of culture conditions and the 3HP biosynthesis pathway. In this study, a novel strategy for improving 3HP production in Escherichia coli was investigated by the modification of central metabolism based on a genome-scale metabolic model and experimental validation.ResultsMetabolic simulation identified the double knockout of tpiA and zwf as a candidate for improving 3HP production. A 3HP-producing strain was constructed by the expression of glycerol dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The double knockout of tpiA and zwf increased the percentage carbon-molar yield (C-mol%) of 3HP on consumed glycerol 4.4-fold (20.1 ± 9.2 C-mol%), compared to the parental strain. Increased extracellular methylglyoxal concentrations in the ΔtpiA Δzwf strain indicated that glycerol catabolism was occurring through the methylglyoxal pathway, which converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to pyruvate, as predicted by the metabolic model. Since the ΔtpiA Δzwf strain produced abundant 1,3-propanediol as a major byproduct (37.7 ± 13.2 C-mol%), yqhD, which encodes an enzyme involved in the production of 1,3-propanediol, was disrupted in the ΔtpiA Δzwf strain. The 3HP yield of the ΔtpiA Δzwf ΔyqhD strain (33.9 ± 1.2 C-mol%) was increased 1.7-fold further compared to the ΔtpiA Δzwf strain and by 7.4-fold compared to the parental strain.ConclusionThis study successfully increased 3HP production by 7.4-fold in the ΔtpiA Δzwf ΔyqhD E. coli strain by the modification of the central metabolism, based on metabolic simulation and experimental validation of engineered strains.",

To remove AAHs from air, polytetrafluoroethylene-nickel oxide (PTFE-NiO) composite nanofiber filter mats (NFMs) were synthesized and characterized for their ability to effectively adsorb AAHs. The NiO-nanoparticle-doped mats were fabricated by green electrospinning of PTFE and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) mixtures added with nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate in the spinning solution followed by surface heat treatment. FE-SEM FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, sessile drop and Jar methods were applied as characterization techniques. The diameter of the electrospun nanofibers without NiO dopant ranged from 0.34 ± 21.61 to 0.23 ± 10.12 µm, whereas a reduction in diameter of NiO-doped nanofibers was obtained, ranging between pristine to 0.25 ± 24.12 µm and 0.12 ± 85.75 µm with heat treatment. 6% (by weight) NiO-doped PTFE composite NFMs exhibited a high water-contact angle of 120 ± 2.20 degrees; the high hydrophobicity value aided self-cleansing property of NFMs for practical applications.

The modes of occurrence of mercury were studied with float-sink experiments of 10 coals from different basins in China and correlation analyses were conducted between concentrations of mercury and maceral and sulfur contents, as well as the ash yield. The theoretic concentrations and affinities of mercury in vitrinite, inertinite, clay and pyrite were then calculated following the methods proposed by Solari. The weighted average concentration of mercury in Chinese coals is 0.154 µg/g, which is similar to that in the word coals in general. The mercury concentrations vary largely in the coals of different coal-forming period and coal-accumulating areas as geological settings play key roles in determining the geochemistry of mercury. The concentrations of mercury in coals from south and southwest China and those from North China of C3–P1 are relatively higher while those from North China of J1–2 and Northeast of J3–K1 relatively lower. The general distribution trends of mercury are very similar to that of ash yield, sulfur contents in coals. Pyrite is the dominant carrier of mercury in most coals, especially in some high-sulfur coals with abundant epigenetic pyrite formed during diagenesis and metamorphism.

        "input": "BackgroundThermophilic fungi have attracted increased interest for their ability to secrete enzymes that deconstruct biomass at high temperatures. However, development of thermophilic fungi as enzyme producers for biomass deconstruction has not been thoroughly investigated. Comparing the enzymatic activities of thermophilic fungal strains that grow on targeted biomass feedstocks has the potential to identify promising candidates for strain development. Thielavia terrestris and Thermoascus aurantiacus were chosen for characterization based on literature precedents.ResultsThermoascus aurantiacus and Thielavia terrestris were cultivated on various biomass substrates and culture supernatants assayed for glycoside hydrolase activities. Supernatants from both cultures possessed comparable glycoside hydrolase activities when incubated with artificial biomass substrates. In contrast, saccharifications of ionic liquid pretreated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) revealed that T. aurantiacus enzymes released more glucose than T. terrestris enzymes over a range of protein mass loadings and temperatures. Temperature-dependent saccharifications demonstrated that the T. aurantiacus proteins retained higher levels of activity compared to a commercial enzyme mixture sold by Novozymes, Cellic CTec2, at elevated temperatures. Enzymes secreted by T. aurantiacus released glucose at similar protein loadings to CTec2 on dilute acid, ammonia fiber expansion, or ionic liquid pretreated switchgrass. Proteomic analysis of the T. aurantiacus culture supernatant revealed dominant glycoside hydrolases from families 5, 7, 10, and 61, proteins that are key enzymes in commercial cocktails.ConclusionsT. aurantiacus produces a complement of secreted proteins capable of higher levels of saccharification of pretreated switchgrass than T. terrestris enzymes. The T. aurantiacus enzymatic cocktail performs at the same level as commercially available enzymatic cocktail for biomass deconstruction, without strain development or genetic modifications.

        "input": "In the literature, it is discussed how the nanostructure of silicon can improve its mechanical stability, e.g., by proposing columnar structures and a particle size below which silicon nanoparticulate anodes can be lithiated/delithiated without breaking6,44–46, or a thickness limit below which silicon thin-film anodes can be stable, which may be increased by patterning the substrate. In either case, however, the nanostructure increases the electrode/electrolyte interface, increasing the Rct and an unstable SEI that is regenerated. This problem can be addressed using shells47–51 to seal nanostructured silicon while maintaining the integrity of the electrode and allowing the formation of a stable SEI; however, this leads to a reduction in LIB energy density, provides a further step in the synthesis of the material and maybe detachment between the shell and the core. Another strategy to enhance the mechanical stability of Si-based anodes is either by increasing the anode’s elastic modulus with new binders for silicon composites16 or by physically constraining volume expansion52.",

Drugs tested include chlorhexidine diacetate (CDA), doxycycline hydrochloride (DOH), tetracycline hydrochloride (TTH) and nystatin (NST). Drug release from the films was examined for at least 14 days in 10 ml ddH2O (NST in water/ethanol (4:1)) which was replaced daily. Changes in optical density were followed spectraphotometrically. Effect of temperature on rate measurements was studied and the energies of activation (E∗) were calculated using Arrhenius plots. Effect of EVA copolymer composition on CDA release rate was also investigated. The enhanced rates with temperature increase may be attributed to the formation of channels with increased geometry in the polymer.

Although their biological function remains largely unknown, WSCP is the only known soluble Chl-binding protein found in higher plants .

Furthermore, these proteins have been localized in the endoplasmic reticulum bodies, only found in Brassicaceae plants, and thought to be involved in the stress response and injury .

        "input": "Since their first discovery by Louis Dunoyer and Otto Stern, molecular beams have conquered research and technology. However, it has remained an outstanding challenge to isolate and photoionize beams of massive neutral polypeptides. Here we show that femtosecond desorption from a matrix-free sample in high vacuum can produce biomolecular beams at least 25 times more efficiently than nanosecond techniques. While it has also been difficult to photoionize large biomolecules, we find that tailored structures with an abundant exposure of tryptophan residues at their surface can be ionized by vacuum ultraviolet light. The combination of these desorption and ionization techniques allows us to observe molecular beams of neutral polypeptides with a mass exceeding 20,000 amu. They are composed of 50 amino acids – 25 tryptophan and 25 lysine residues – and 26 fluorinated alkyl chains.

Early theoretical estimates based on density functional theory (DFT)32 instead placed λ ≈ 0.33 (integrated over all branches), with the strongest coupling occurring to an optical phonon branch dispersing between 66 and 74 meV. However, recent calculations using more sophisticated hybrid functionals found that the inclusion of the long-range Coulomb interaction could enhance the e-ph coupling, leading to λ between 1 and 1.331. Similarly, DFT calculations emphasizing the negative charge transfer character of the bismuthates also derive strong e-ph coupling to the q = (π, π, π)a−1 mode of the optical bond-stretching phonon branch and estimated λ ≈ 0.8930.",

The precision of the CO production was evaluated in a series of experiments performed on a 3.0 mmol scale of the aryl iodide 2 and the corresponding amine 3. In each experiment, the galvanostat was pre-programmed to generate from 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 to 2.5 mmol CO from the CO2 saturated DMF solution containing the catalyst FeTTP. The quantity of moclobemide produced was measured directly from the reaction mixture by HPLC analysis compared to an internal standard. As can be seen from the graph (Fig. 3d), a good correlation (R2 = 0.994) with a slope = 1.12 was obtained for the amount of moclobemide (average of two runs) generated with the quantity set for electrochemical CO production. The higher than unity slope would suggest that the amount of CO produced is slightly greater than expected.

In the vials, the wavelength reflected by the iridescent solutions decreases in time and a L-handed cholesteric phase was observed, indicating that the value of the pitch P decreases, and that no inversion of the helix handedness occurs. No evaporation of TFA and water was allowed in the sealed vials and the quantity of TFA is larger compared with the amount of water present in the system (the medium is acid). The decrease of the pitch can be associated with the adjustment of the conformation of the cellulosic chain to the acidic medium.

Although TiO2 was not directly excited in this study, the Honda–Fujishima effect was observed even with the irradiation of near-infrared light by harnessing the plasmonic antenna effect. In particular, water oxidation via a four-electron transfer with near-infrared radiation would be challenging owing to a large overpotential. It was speculated that multiple holes formed at the restricted nanospace as a result of the electromagnetic field enhancement induced by LSPR excitation, enabling the oxidation of two water molecules simultaneously and dramatically reducing the overpotential. These results indicate that this photoelectric conversion system can be applied to artificial photosynthesis systems. Significantly, this system constitutes an enormous stride forward by providing the potential to exceed the photosynthetic capabilities of green plants through photosystem II (λ: 680 nm) by enabling the conversion of a wider range of wavelengths, including near-infrared light, which is not currently used in conventional artificial photosynthesis systems.",

        "input": "Secondly, our geochemical modeling reveals that in a system with only micromolar ambient sulfate, the vast majority of sulfate ions required to achieve barite saturation must be derived from respired organic matter in protected microenvironments. However, the emergence of microbes capable of sulfate reduction (after ~3.5 Ga4) would have dramatically altered the chemical landscape within these microenvironments, as any accumulated sulfate could henceforth be utilized as an oxidant to further mineralize organic matter. The net effect would be to reduce the amount of sulfate accumulating in particulate microenvironments, thereby depressing Ωbarite at the sites of pelagic barite formation and requiring significantly more organic matter remineralization to achieve barite saturation (akin to the Ba-only scenario; Fig. 5). It is thus tempting to speculate that the rise to ecological prominence of sulfate-reducing microbes ~3.0 Ga was the proximal cause of the ~1 Gyr hiatus in bedded barite sedimentation5,20 that only ended after the Great Oxidation Event (starting ≈ 2.44 Ga65), presumably as surface ocean concentrations of sulfate (and oxygen) rose to levels that enabled pelagic barite precipitation to resume.",

It was shown that the effects of organic salts on the yield of 1,3,5-trioxane in reaction solution and distillate follow the order CH3NaO3S < C6H5NaO3S < C7H7NaO3S < C6H4NNaO5S, which is inversely related to the charge density of the anions of the organic salts. In comparison with Cl−-based salts such as magnesium chloride, organic salts have the advantages of less formic acid generation and low corrosion. Studies on water activity revealed that the effect of organic salts on the activity of water was quite small at low concentration of organic salts. UV–visible spectroscopy and vapor–liquid equilibrium experiments were performed to uncover the mechanisms that govern such effects. The results showed that the effect of organic salts on the yield of 1,3,5-trioxane relies primarily on their ability to increase the catalytic activity of sulfuric acid and increase the relative volatilities of 1,3,5-trioxane and water and of 1,3,5-trioxane and oligomers.",

During growth, plant cells are surrounded by a strong yet adaptable primary cell wall, which is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectins, and proteins . Once growth has ceased, an additional secondary wall may be deposited, which is mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Cellulose, consisting of linear chains of β-1,4-linked glucan, is the principal substrate for bioethanol production. Through intra- and inter-chain hydrogen bonding, parallel linear glucan chains are crystalized to form cellulose microfibrils that provide plants with excellent toughness for normal plant growth . Crystallinity index (CrI) is a parameter commonly used to quantify cellulose microfibrils crystallinity , which is one of the most important characteristics of cellulose negatively affecting biomass enzymatic hydrolysis . Hemicelluloses are a heterogeneous class of polysaccharides with various sugar units, and arabinoxylans comprise the majority of hemicelluloses in the mature tissues of rice . Lignin is a complex phenolic polymer that provide plants with great stiffness for resistance of biotic or abiotic stress .",

Most importantly, the Ru 4d bands of NaRu2O4 exhibit the delicate balance between the correlations, the Coulomb U, and the bandwidth W. Two other factors play a crucial role: orbital freedom, leading to orbitally-driven dimerization, and the mixed-valence of Ru, Ru3.5+, promoting site-centered charge ordering. These features seem to be the key to realizing charge ordering and dimer coexistence in a metallic NaRu2O4.

When these 2D graphitic nanosheets are doped into organic photorefractive devices, all-optically controlled photorefractive performance without any external electric field is effectively improved because the built-in electric field is strengthened inside organic nanographite-doped photorefractive devices. It is attributed to the effective charge separation under the nonuniform light field caused by the excellent electric conductance of 2D graphitic nanosheets. As a result, the orientation enhancement effect in organic photorefractive devices is strengthened. Finally, the gain coefficient of two-beam coupling in the all-optical operation is enhanced about 46.4% from 80.1 cm−1 of control device to 117.2 cm−1 of nanographite-doped device.

More than five orders of magnitude adjustment over the film resistivity and carrier concentration were achieved by tuning the O2 plasma times. Finer tuning of the properties can also be realized by varying the number of thermal ALD cycles in a supercycle. The tuning of these electrical properties is believed to be associated with the change of hydrogen defect concentration in the film. This directly causes the shift of Fermi levels within the ZnO films as revealed by the Kelvin probe force microscopy. By adopting a simple electronic energy model, the carrier concentrations calculated from the Fermi level shifts demonstrate a good match with the Hall effect measurement results. This reliable and robust technique reported here clearly points towards the capability of using this method to produce ZnO films with controlled properties in different applications.",

We quantitatively determined the drift velocity of collective migration to be on the order of 100 μm s−1 with an activation barrier of 0.79 eV, indicating a significantly large ionic mobility of 2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 V−1 at a remarkably low temperature of 390 °C. In addition, visualization enables direct observation of fluidic behavior, such as the enhancement of conduction at channel edges, which results in U-shaped viscous propagation of the phase boundary and turbulence under a reverse electric field.

        "input": "Considering that the conventional glasses have less polymerized glassy networks, with the occurrence of Q1 and even Q0 units, as indicated by thermal analysis and Raman spectra, one could infer that the terminal P–O bonds can symmetrically stretch with more ease. This is the reason why the νs(P–Ot) stretching mode appears in a lower energy region in the Raman spectra of the conventional glasses. In the coacervate, on the other hand, the coacervation process produces longer and highly branched polyphosphate chains, in a compact amorphous structure. In this way, the symmetrical P–Ot stretching mode requires more energy and appears in a higher energy region of the Raman spectrum. Since methanol use in the coacervates acts mainly in the chain agglomeration, and less on the chain connectivity, the feature described above does not depend on the coacervate synthesis method.",

        "input": "Recently issues of selenium water contamination are associated with selenium biochemical risks. For instance, from the 210 ground water samples taken in Nigeria, selenium concentration of 7.33 ± 6.22–46.3 ± 22.4 µg/L is reported following the needed assessment vis-à-vis risk of geogenic contamination which is almost greater than that of WHO’s limit of 10 µg/l  (Table 1). The distribution of selenium was fairly uniform in the samples studied in different locations that suggested the influence of geogenic factors. More than that, in some parts of the United States dark-gray shale sampled from 51 locations in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, many of the groundwater samples were found saline with selenium concentration of 1000 µg/l  which is 100 times beyond the limit recommended by the WHO.",
