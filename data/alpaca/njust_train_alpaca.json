        "input": "Generative Semantic Hashing Enhanced via Boltzmann Machines Abstract Generative semantic hashing is a promising technique for large-scale information retrieval thanks to its fast retrieval speed and small memory footprint. For the tractability of training, existing generative-hashing methods mostly assume a factorized form for the posterior distribution, enforcing independence among the bits of hash codes. From the perspectives of both model representation and code space size, independence is always not the best assumption. In this paper , to introduce correlations among the bits of hash codes , we propose to employ the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the variational posterior . To address the intractability issue of training , we first develop an approximate method to reparameterize the distribution of a Boltzmann machine by augmenting it as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution . Based on that, an asymptotically-exact lower bound is further derived for the evidence lower bound ( ELBO ). With these novel techniques, the entire model can be optimized efficiently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by effectively modeling correlations among different bits within a hash code, our model can achieve significant performance gains. 1 Introduction Similarity search, also known as nearest-neighbor search, aims to find items that are similar to a query from a large dataset. It plays an important role in modern information retrieval systems and has been used in various applications, ranging from plagiarism analysis ( Stein et al., 2007 ) to content-based multimedia retrieval ( Lew et al., 2006 ), etc. However, looking for nearest neighbors in the Euclidean space is often computationally prohibitive for large-scale datasets ( calculating cosine similarity with high-dimensional vectors is computationally-expensive ).",

        "input": "Semantic hashing circumvents this problem by representing semantically similar documents with compact and binary codes. Accordingly, similar documents can be retrieved by evaluating the hamming distances of their hash codes much more efficiently. To obtain similarity-preserving hash codes, extensive efforts have been made to learn hash functions that can preserve the similarity information of original documents in the binary embedding space ( Shen et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016 ). Existing methods often require the availability of label information, which is often expensive to obtain in practice. To avoid the use of labels, generative semantic hashing methods have been developed. Specifically , the variational autoencoder ( VAE ) is first employed for semantic hashing in ( Chaidaroon and Fang , 2017 ) , and their model is termed VDSH . As a two-step process , the continuous document representations obtained from VAE are directly converted into binary hash codes . To resolve the two-step training problem , Bernoulli priors are leveraged as the prior distribution in NASH ( Shen et al . , 2018 ) , replacing the continuous Gaussian prior in VDSH . By utilizing straight-through ( ST ) technique ( Bengio et al . , 2013 ) , their model can be trained in an end-to-end manner , while keeping the merits of VDSH . Recently , to further improve the quality of hash codes , mixture priors are investigated in BMSH ( Dong et al . , 2019 ) , while more accurate gradient estimators are studied in Doc2hash ( Zhang and Zhu , 2019 ) , both under a similar framework as NASH .",

        "input": "Due to the training-tractability issue , the aforementioned generative hashing methods all assume a factorized variational form for the posterior , e.g . , independent Gaussian in VDSH and independent Bernoulli in NASH , BMSH and Doc2hash . This assumption prevents the models from capturing dependencies among the bits of hash codes. Although uncorrelated bits are sometimes preferred in hashing, as reported in ( Zhang and Li, 2014 ), this may not apply to generative semantic hashing. This is due to the fact that the independent assumption could severely limit a model’s ability to yield meaningful representations and thereby produce high-quality hash codes. Moreover, as the code length increases ( to e.g. 128 bits ), the number of possible codes ( or simply the code space ) will be too large for a dataset with limited number of data points. As a result, we advocate that correlations among bits of a hash code should be considered properly to restrict the embedding space, and thus enable a model to work effectively under a broad range of code lengths. To introduce correlations among bits of hash codes , we propose to adopt the Boltzmann-machine ( BM ) distribution ( Ackley et al . , 1985 ) as a variational posterior to capture various complex correlations . One issue with this setting, relative to existing efficient training methods, is the inefficiency brought in training. To address this issue , we first prove that the BM distribution can be augmented as a hierarchical concatenation of a Gaussian-like distribution and a Bernoulli distribution . Using this result , we then show that samples from BM distributions can be well reparameterized easily .",

        "input": "To enable efficient learning , an asymptotically-exact lower bound of the standard evidence lower bound ( ELBO ) is further developed to deal with the notorious problem of the normalization term in Boltzmann machines . With the proposed reparameterization and the new lower bound, our model can be trained efficiently as the previous generative hashing models that preserve no bit correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. It is observed that on all three public datasets considered, the proposed model achieves the best performance among all comparable models. In particular, thanks to the introduced correlations, we observe the performance of the proposed model does not deteriorate as the code length increases. This is surprising and somewhat contrary to what has been observed in other generative hashing models. 2 Preliminaries Generative Semantic Hashing. In the context of generative semantic hashing, each document is represented by a sequence of words x = {w1, w2, · · · , w|x|}, where wi is the i-th word and is denoted by a |V |-dimensional one-hot vector; |x| and |V | denotes the document size ( number of words ) and the vocabulary size, respectively. Each document x is modeled by a joint probability: where s is a latent variable representing the document’s hash code. With the probability pθ( x, s ) trained on a set of documents, the hash code for a document x can be derived directly from the posterior distribution pθ( s|x ). In existing works, the likelihood function, or the decoder takes a form where E ∈ Rm×|V | is the matrix connecting the latent code s and the one-hot representation of words; and ej is the one-hot vector with the only ‘1’ locating at the i-th position.",

        "input": "Documents could be modelled better by using more expressive likelihood functions , e.g . , deep neural networks , but as explained in ( Shen et al . , 2018 ) , they are more likely to destroy the crucial distance-keeping property for semantic hashing . Thus, the simple form of ( 2 ) is often preferred in generative hashing. As for the prior distribution p ( s ) , it is often chosen as the standard Gaussian distribution as in VDSH ( Chaidaroon and Fang , 2017 ) , or the Bernoulli distribution as in NASH and BMSH ( Shen et al . , 2018 ; Dong et al . , 2019 ) . Inference. Probabilistic models can be trained by maximizing the log-likelihood log pθ( x ) with pθ( x ) = ∫ s pθ( x, s )ds. However, due to the intractability of calculating pθ( x ), we instead optimize its evidence lower bound ( ELBO ), i.e., where qφ( s|x ) is the proposed variational posterior parameterized by φ. It can be shown that log pθ( x ) ≥ L holds for any qφ( s|x ) , and that if qφ( s|x ) is closer to the true posterior pθ( s|x ), the bound L will be tighter. Training then reduces to maximizing the lower bound L w.r.t. θ and φ. In VDSH ( Chaidaroon and Fang , 2017 ) , qφ ( s | x ) takes the form of an independent Gaussian distribution : where µφ ( x ) and σφ ( x ) are two vector-valued functions parameterized by multi-layer perceptrons ( MLP ) with parameters φ . Later , in NASH and BMSH ( Shen et al . , 2018 ; Dong et al . , 2019 ) , qφ ( s | x ) is defined as an independent Bernoulli distribution , i.e . , where gφ ( x ) is also vector-valued function parameterized by a MLP .",

        "input": "The value at each dimension represents the probability of being 1 at that position. The MLP used to parameterize the posterior qφ ( s | x ) is also referred to as the encoder network . One key requirement for efficient end-to-end training of generative hashing method is the availability of reparameterization for the variational distribution qφ( s|x ). For example, when qφ( s|x ) is a Gaussian distribution as in ( 4 ), a sample s from it can be efficiently reparameterized as with \u000f ∼ N ( 0, I ). When qφ( s|x ) is a Bernoulli distribution as in ( 5 ), a sample from it can be reparameterized as where \u000f ∈ Rm with elements \u000fi ∼ uniform( 0, 1 ). With these reparameterization tricks, the lower bound in ( 3 ) can be estimated by the sample s as L ≈ log pθ( x|sφ )p( sφ ) where s has been denoted as sφ to explicitly indicate its dependence on φ. To train these hashing models , the backpropagation algorithm can be employed to estimate the gradient of ( 8 ) w.r.t . θ and φ easily . However, it is worth noting that in order to use the reparameterization trick, all existing methods assumed a factorized form for the proposed posterior qφ( s|x ), as shown in ( 4 ) and ( 5 ). This suggests that the binary bits in hash codes are independent of each other, which is not the best setting in generative semantic hashing. 3 Correlation-Enhanced Generative Semantic Hashing In this section , we present a scalable and efficient approach to introducing correlations into the bits of hash codes , by using a Boltzmann-machine distribution as the variational posterior with approximate reparameterization . 3.1 Boltzmann Machine as the Variational Posterior Many probability distributions defined over binary variables s ∈ {0, 1}m are able to capture the dependencies. Among them , the most famous one should be the Boltzmann-machine distribution ( Ackley et al . , 1985 ) , which takes the following form : where Σ ∈ Rm × m and µ ∈ Rm are the distribution parameters ; and Z , ∑ s e 1 2 sTΣs + µT s is the normalization constant .",

        "input": "The Boltzmann-machine distribution can be adopted to model correlations among the bits of a hash code . Specifically, by restricting the posterior to the Boltzmann form and substituting it into the lower bound of ( 3 ), we can write the lower bound as: where Eφ( s ) , −12sTΣφ( x )s − µTφ ( x )s; and Σφ( x ) and µφ( x ) are functions parameterized by the encoder network with parameters φ and x as input. One problem with such modeling is that the expectation term Eqφ( s|x )[·] in ( 11 ) cannot be expressed in a closed form due to the complexity of qφ( s|x ). Consequently, one cannot directly optimize the lower bound L w.r.t. θ and φ. 3.2 Reparameterization An alternative way is to approximate the expectation term by using the reparameterized form of a sample s from qφ( s|x ), as was done in the previous uncorrelated generative hashing models ( see ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) ). Compared to existing simple variational distributions , there is no existing work on how to reparameterize the complicated Boltzmannmachine distribution . To this end , we first show that the Boltzmann-machine distribution can be equivalently written as the composition of an approximate correlated Gaussian distribution and a Bernoulli distribution . Proposition 1. A Boltzmann-machine distribution b ( s ) = 1Z e 1 2 sTΣs + µT s with Σ 0 can be equivalently expressed as the composition of two distributions , that is , where p ( r ) = 1Z ∏ m i = 1 ( e ri + 1 ) · N ( r ; µ , Σ ) ; p ( s | r ) = ∏ mi = 1 p ( si | ri ) with si and ri denoting the i-th element of s and r ; and p ( si | ri ) , Bernoulli ( σ ( ri ) ) with σ ( · ) being the sigmoid function .

        "input": "Based on Proposition 1 , we can see that a sample from the Boltzmann-machine distribution qφ ( s | x ) in ( 10 ) can be sampled hierarchically as where and σ ( · ) is applied to its argument element-wise . From the expression of qφ( r|x ), we can see that for small values of ri, the influence of ( eri + 1 ) on the overall distribution is negligible, and thus qφ( r|x ) can be well approximated by the Gaussian distribution N ( r;µφ( x ),Σφ( x ) ). For relatively large ri, the term ( eri + 1 ) will only influence the distribution mean, roughly shifting the Gaussian distribution N ( r;µφ( x ),Σφ( x ) ) by an amount approximately equal to its variance. For problems of interest in this paper, the variances of posterior distribution are often small, hence it is reasonable to approximate samples from qφ( r|x ) by those from N ( r;µφ( x ),Σφ( x ) ). With this approximation , we can now draw samples from Boltzmann-machine distribution qφ ( s | x ) in ( 10 ) approximately by the two steps below For the Gaussian sample r ∼ N ( r ; µφ ( x ) , Σφ ( x ) ) , similar to ( 6 ) , it can be reparameterized as where Lφ ( x ) is the Cholesky decomposition matrix of Σφ ( x ) with Σφ ( x ) = Lφ ( x ) LTφ ( x ) ; and  ∈ Rm with  ∼ N ( 0 , I ) . It should be noted that in practice, we can define the function Lφ( x ) in advance and then obtain Σφ( x ) as Σφ( x ) = Lφ( x )LTφ ( x ), thus the Cholesky decomposition is not needed. Given the Gaussian sample r, similar to the reparameterization of Bernoulli variables in ( 7 ), we can reparameterize the Bernoulli sample s ∼ Bernoulli( σ( r ) ) as s = sign( σ( r )−u )+12 , where u ∈ Rm with each element ui ∼ uniform( 0, 1 ). By combining the above reparameterizations , a sample from the Boltzmann-machine distribution qφ ( s | x ) can then be approximately reparameterized as where the subscript φ is to explicitly indicate that the sample s is expressed in terms of φ . With the reparameterization sφ, the expectation term in ( 11 ) can be approximated as log pθ( x|sφ )p( sφ ) e −Eφ( sφ ) . Consequently , the gradients of this term w.r.t . both θ and φ can be evaluated efficiently by backpropagation , with the only difficulty lying at the non-differentiable function sign ( · ) of sφ in ( 18 ) .",

Here , we adopt the simple straight-through ( ST ) technique ( Bengio et al . , 2013 ) , which has been found performing well in many applications . By simply treating the hard threshold function sign ( · ) as the identity function , the ST technique estimates the gradient as . Then , the gradient of the first term in ELBO L w.r.t . φ can be computed efficiently by backpropagation . 3.3 An Asymptotically-Exact Lower Bound To optimize the ELBO in ( 11 ), we still need to calculate the gradient of logZφ, which is known to be notoriously difficult. A common way is to estimate the gradient ∂ logZφ ∂ φ by MCMC methods ( Tieleman , 2008 ; Desjardins et al . , 2010 ; Su et al . , 2017a , b ) , which are computationally expensive and often of high variance . By noticing a special form of the ELBO ( 11 ), we develop a lower bound for the ELBO L, where the logZφ term can be conveniently cancelled out. Specifically, we introduce another probability distribution h( s ) and lower bound the original ELBO: Since KL( · ) ≥ 0, we have L˜( θ, φ ) ≤ L holds for all h( s ), i.e., L˜ is a lower bound of L, and equals to the ELBO L when h( s ) = qφ( s|x ). For the choice of h( s ), it should be able to reduce the gap between L˜ and L as much as possible, while ensuring that the optimization is tractable. Balancing on the two sides, a mixture distribution is used where k denotes the number of components; p( s|r( i ) ) is the multivariate Bernoulli distribution and r( i ) is the i-th sample drawn from qφ( r|x ) as defined in ( 14 ). By substituting hk( s ) into ( 20 ) and taking the expectation w.r.t. r( i ), we have where qφ( r( 1··· ,k )|x ) = ∏k i=1 qφ( r ( i )|x ).",

The elements of Lφ( x ) are often designed as the outputs of neural networks parameterized by φ. Therefore, if m is large, the number of neural network outputs will be too large. To overcome this issue, a more parameter-efficient strategy called Low-Rank Perturbation is employed, which restricts covariance matrix to the form where D is a diagonal matrix with positive entries and U = [u1, u2, · · ·uv] is a low-rank perturbation matrix with ui ∈ Rm and v \u001c m. Under this low-rank perturbed Σ, the Gaussian samples can be reparameterized as where \u000f1 ∼ N ( 0, Im ) and \u000f2 ∼ N ( 0, Iv ).

Locality-Sensitive Hashing , one of the most popular hashing methods ( Datar et al . , 2004 ) , projects documents into low-dimensional hash codes in a randomized manner . However, the method does not leverage any information of data, and thus generally performs much worse than those data-dependent methods. Among the datadependent methods, one of the mainstream methods is supervised hashing, which learns a function that could output similar hash codes for semantically similar documents by making effective use of the label information ( Shen et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016 ). Different from supervised methods, unsupervised hashing pays more attention to the intrinsic structure of data, without making use of the labels. Spectral hashing ( Weiss et al., 2009 ), for instance, learns balanced and uncorrelated hash codes by seeking to preserve a global similarity structure of documents. Self-taught hashing ( Zhang et al., 2010 ), on the other hand, focuses more on preserving local similarities among documents and presents a two-stage training procedure to obtain such hash codes. In contrast, to generate high-quality hash codes, iterative quantization ( Gong et al., 2013 ) aims to minimize the quantization error, while maximizing the variance of each bit at the same time. Among the unsupervised hashing methods, the idea of generative semantic hashing has gained much interest in recent years. Under the VAE framework , VDSH ( Chaidaroon and Fang , 2017 ) was proposed to first learn continuous the documents ’ latent representations , which are then cast into binary codes .",

        "input": "While semantic hashing is achieved with generative models nicely , the twostage training procedure is problematic and is prone to result in local optima . To address this issue , NASH ( Shen et al . , 2018 ) went one step further and presented an integrated framework to enable the end-to-end training by using the discrete Bernoulli prior and the ST technique , which is able to estimate the gradient of functions with discrete variables . Since then , various directions have been explored to improve the performance of NASH . ( Dong et al., 2019 ) proposed to employ the mixture priors to improve the model’s capability to distinguish documents from different categories, and thereby improving the quality of hash codes. On the other hand , a more accurate gradient estimator called Gumbel-Softmax ( Jang et al . , 2017 ; Maddison et al . , 2017 ) is explored in Doc2hash ( Zhang and Zhu , 2019 ) to replace the ST estimator in NASH . More recently, to better model the similarities between different documents, ( Hansen et al., 2019 ) investigated the combination of generative models and ranking schemes to generate hash codes. Different from the aforementioned generative semantic hashing methods, in this paper, we focus on how to incorporate correlations into the bits of hash codes. 5 Experiments 5.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. Following previous works , we evaluate our model on three public benchmark datasets : i ) Reuters21578 , which consists of 10788 documents with 90 categories ; ii ) 20Newsgroups , which contains 18828 newsgroup posts from 20 different topics ; iii ) TMC , which is a collection of 21519 documents categorized into 22 classes . Training Details. For the conveniences of comparisons , we use the same network architecture as that in NASH and BMSH . Specifically , a 2 - layer feed-forward neural network with 500 hidden units and a ReLU activation function is used as an inference network , which receives the TF-IDF of a document as input and outputs the mean and covariance matrix of the Gaussian random variables r .",

        "input": "Compared to the generative hashing method NASH without considering correlations , we can see that the proposed method , which introduces correlations among bits by simply employing the distribution of Boltzmann machine as the posterior , performs significantly better on all the three datasets considered . This strongly corroborates the benefits of taking correlations into account when learning the hash codes. From the tables , we can also observe that the proposed model even outperforms the BMSH , an enhanced variant of NASH that employs more complicated mixture distributions as a prior . Since only the simplest prior is used in the proposed model , larger performance gains can be expected if mixture priors are used as in BMSH . Notably , a recent work named RBSH is proposed in ( Hansen et al . , 2019 ) , which improves NASH by specifically ranking the documents according to their similarities . However, since it employs a different data preprocessing technique as the existing works, we cannot include its results for a direct comparison here. Nevertheless, we trained our model on their preprocessed datasets and find that our method still outperforms it. For details about the results, please refer to Appendix A.4. Moreover, when examining the retrieval performance of hash codes under different lengths, it is observed that the performance of our proposed method never deteriorates as the code length increases, while other models start to perform poorly after the length of codes reaching a certain level. For the most comparable methods like VDSH , NASH and BMSH , it can be seen that the performance of 128 bits is generally much worse than that of 64 bits .",

        "input": "This phenomenon is illustrated more clearly in Figure 1. This may attribute to the reason that for hash codes without correlations, the number of codes will increase exponentially as the code length increases. Because the code space is too large, the probability of assigning similar items to nearby binary codes may decrease significantly. But for the proposed model, since the bits of hash codes are correlated to each other, the effective number of codes can be determined by the strength of correlations among bits, effectively restricting the size of code space. Therefore, even though the code length increases continually, the performance of our proposed model does not deteriorate. 5.3 Empirical Study of Computational Efficiency To show the computational efficiency of our proposed method , we also report the average running time per epoch in GPU on TMC dataset , which is of the largest among the considered ones , in Table 4 . As a benchmark , the average training time of vanilla NASH is 2.553s per epoch . It can be seen that because of to the use of low-rank parameterization of the covariance matrix , the proposed model can be trained almost as efficiently as vanilla NASH , but deliver a much better performance . 5.4 Hash Codes Visualization To further investigate the capability of different models in generating semantic-preserving binary codes , we project the hash codes produced by VDSH , NASH and our proposed model on 20Newsgroups datasets onto a two-dimensional plane by using the widely adopted UMAP technique ( McInnes et al . , 2018 ) and then visualize them on the twodimensional planes , as shown in Figure 2 . It can be seen that the hash codes produced by VDSH are quite mixed for documents from different categories , while those produced by NASH are more distinguishable , consistent with the hypothesis that NASH is able to produce better codes than VDSH thanks to the end-to-end training . From the figure, we can further observe that the hash codes produced by our proposed method are the most distinguishable among all three methods considered, corroborating the benefits of introducing correlations among the bits of hash codes. 5.5 Analyses on the Impacts of v and k Ranks v.

To investigate its impacts, we evaluate the performance of the 64bit hash codes obtained from the proposed model under different values of v, with the other key parameter k fixed to 10. The result is listed in the left half of Table 5. Notably , the proposed model with v = 0 is equivalent to NASH since there is not any correlation between the binary random variables . It can be seen that as the number of ranks increases , the retrieval precisions also increase , justifying the hypothesis that employing the posteriors with correlations can increase the model ’ s representational capacity and thereby improves the hash codes ’ quality in turn .

This indicates that it is feasible to set the v to a relatively small value to save computational resources while retaining competitive performance. The number of mixture components k.

        "input": "PLATO: Pre-trained Dialogue Generation Model with Discrete Latent Variable Abstract Pre-training models have been proved effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Inspired by this, we propose a novel dialogue generation pre-training framework to support various kinds of conversations, including chit-chat, knowledge grounded dialogues, and conversational question answering. In this framework , we adopt flexible attention mechanisms to fully leverage the bi-directional context and the uni-directional characteristic of language generation . We also introduce discrete latent variables to tackle the inherent one-to-many mapping problem in response generation. Two reciprocal tasks of response generation and latent act recognition are designed and carried out simultaneously within a shared network. Comprehensive experiments on three publicly available datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework. 1 Introduction Dialogue generation is a challenging task due to the limited corpus of human conversations, complex background knowledge, and diverse relationships between utterances. Recently , pre-trained large-scale language models , such as BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) and XLNet ( Yang et al . , 2019 ) , have achieved prominent success in natural language processing . Such models are usually constructed based on a massive scale of general text corpora , like English Wikipedia or BooksCorpus ( Zhu et al . , 2015 ) , where distributed representations can be learned automatically from the raw text . With these representations being fine-tuned, breakthroughs have been continuously reported for various downstream tasks, especially those on natural language understanding, such as question answering, natural language inference, and so on. This pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm also sheds light on the tasks of natural language generation, like dialogue generation.",

        "input": "However , the previous study demonstrates that there are some deficiencies in performance while directly fine-tuning BERT on small conversation datasets ( Rashkin et al . , 2019 ; Wolf et al . , 2019 ) . Possible reasons are three-fold : 1 ) the underlying linguistic patterns in human conversations can be highly different from those in general text , which suggests a potentially large gap in knowledge or data distribution ; 2 ) the training mode of uni-directional dialogue generation is also distinct from that of bi-directional natural language understating as applied in BERT ; 3 ) unlike most of the general NLP tasks , there exists a one-to-many relationship in dialogue generation , where the dialogue context may correspond to multiple appropriate replies . In this paper, we propose a new method to tackle the above challenges, aiming to obtain a high-quality pre-training model for dialogue generation. First of all , to reduce the gap between data distributions , large-scale Reddit and Twitter conversations are utilized to further pre-train the generation model ( upon the basis of language models pre-trained with general text ) . Secondly, to mitigate the difference in training mode, a flexible paradigm integrating uni- and bi-directional processing is employed in this work, which is inspired by the latest unified language modeling ( Dong et al., 2019 ). Thirdly, a discrete latent variable is introduced to model the one-to-many relationship among utterances in conversations. Each value of the latent variable corresponds to the particular conversational intent of one response, which is referred as latent speech act. Distinct with those controllable dialogue generation based on explicit labels ( including emotion, keywords, domain codes, and so on ) ( Huang et al., 2018; Keskar et al., 2019 ), our latent variable gets exempted from the restriction of human annotations and can be learned automatically from the corpus in an unsupervised way. In the pre-training of dialogue generation, response generation and latent act recognition are carried out simultaneously within a shared network. Based on the context and latent variable, the generation task tries to maximize the likelihood of the target response.",

        "input": "Meanwhile, the recognition task aims to estimate the latent variable w.r.t. the given context and target response. Apparently, the accurate recognition of the latent variable is a crucial factor in boosting the quality of response generation. We conducted experiments on three different kinds of conversation tasks: chit-chat, knowledge grounded conversation, and conversational question answering. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of our pre-trained model as compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Our pre-trained models and source code have been released at GitHub, hoping to facilitate further research progress in dialogue generation.1 2 Dialogue Generation Pre-training Given a piece of context, there exist multiple appropriate responses, leading to diverse conversation flows. It is widely recognized that the capability of modeling one-to-many relationship is crucial for the dialogue generation system ( Zhao et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019 ). To this end, we propose to encode discrete latent variables into transformer blocks for one-to-many relationship modeling, where two reciprocal tasks of response generation and latent act recognition are collaboratively carried out. 2.1 Model Architecture In our model, there are three elements: dialogue context c, response r and latent variable z. The dialogue context c consists of several history utterances. ( For knowledge grounded conversation, it is conventional to concatenate background knowledge into the context as well ( Wolf et al., 2019 )? ) The response r is one piece of appropriate reply towards the given context. The latent variable z is one K-way categorical variable z ∈ [1,K], with each value corresponding to a particular latent speech act in the response. The probabilistic relationships among these elements are elaborated with the graphical model in Figure 1.",

Conditioned on the context and one selected latent speech act, the response is generated as p( r|c, z ) ( gray lines ). Given a pair of context and response, the underlying latent speech act can be estimated as p( z|c, r ) ( dashed blue lines ). As such, our pretraining of dialogue generation contains the following two tasks – response generation and latent act recognition. We propose a unified infrastructure for the joint learning of both tasks, shown as Figure 2. The backbone of our infrastructure is inspired by the transformer blocks in ( Dong et al., 2019 ), which supports both bi-directional encoding and uni-directional decoding flexibly via specific selfattention masks. Both response generation and latent act recognition are carried out under the unified network with shared parameters. Their detailed implementations are described as follows. Given the context c and a specific speech act z, the response generation can be estimated as where T is the length of the target response r and r<t denotes previously generated words. Since the response generation is a uni-directional decoding process, each token in the response only attends to those before it, shown as dashed orange lines in Figure 2.",

As shown in Figure 2, with a special mask symbol [M] as input, it keeps collecting information from the context and target response ( red lines ). In this way, the corresponding speech act for the target response can be recognized as z ∼ p( z|c, r ), where p( z|c, r ) is the estimated posterior distribution over discrete latent values. 2.2 Input Representation For multi-turn conversation modeling, elaborate designs have been made on the input representation in this work. For each token, its input embedding is the sum of corresponding token, role, turn and position embeddings. One visual example is shown in Figure 3 and details are described in the following. The input is the concatenation of latent variable, dialogue context and response. Following the pre-processing of BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) , the input text is tokenized with WordPiece ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . A special end-of-utterance [EOU] token is appended to the end of each utterance for separation.

The role embedding EA is added for the response, as well as dialogue utterances generated by the same character in the context. And role embedding EB is used for the other character. ( For knowledge grounded conversation,EC is used as the role embedding of background knowledge? ) In the interactive conversation, there are multi-turn utterances and we employ relative order in the assignment of turn embeddings. The turn embedding for the response is set to E[0], and the turn embedding of its last utterance is E[−1], and etc. Our utilization of relative turn embeddings instead of absolute ones enables the model to assign turn embedding E[0] to the response consistently and makes response generation exempt from the disturbance of its round number within the dialogue. Position embeddings are added according to the token position in each utterance. Note that for the special token of latent variable, its corresponding role, turn and position embeddings are all set to empty. 2.3 Pre-training Objectives We employ three loss functions in dialogue generation pre-training: negative log-likelihood ( NLL ) loss, bag-of-words ( BOW ) loss and response selection ( RS ) loss.

        "input": "The widely adopted NLL loss is embraced in the pre-training: where z is the latent speech act of this training pair ( c, r ), sampled from the probability distribution p( z|c, r ). The posterior distribution over latent values is estimated through the task of latent act recognition: where h[M ] ∈ RD is the final hidden state of the special mask, W1 ∈ RK×D and b1 ∈ RK denote the weight matrices of one fully-connected layer. Besides the classical NLL loss, the bag-of-words loss ( Zhao et al., 2017 ) is also employed to facilitate the training process of latent discrete variables: where V refers to the whole vocabulary. The function f tries to predict the words within the target response in a non-autoregressive way: where hz is the final hidden state of the latent variable and |V | is the vocabulary size. frt denotes the estimated probability of word rt. As compared with NLL loss, the BOW loss discards the order of words and forces the latent variable to capture the global information of the target response. 2.3.2 Response Selection Response selection helps distinguish whether the response is relevant with the dialogue context and consistent with the background knowledge. Meanwhile, its score can be regarded as an indicator of coherence during inference, helping to select the most coherent one from multiple candidate responses. Particularly, the training of response selection is carried out together with the bi-directional encoding of latent act recognition. The positive training samples come from the dialogue context and corresponding target response ( c, r ), with label lr = 1. And the negative samples are created by randomly selecting responses from the corpus ( c, r− ), with label lr− = 0. The binary cross-entropy loss of response selection is defined as follows: The above probability is estimated through one fully-connected layer, with the final hidden state of the special mask fed as input: To sum up, the total objective of our pre-training model is to minimize the integrated loss: 2.4 Pre-training Procedure Our pre-training model contains 12 transformer blocks , with network parameters initialized using BERTBASE .",

For each training sample of context and target response ( c, r ), it needs to pass through the network twice to accomplish the tasks of latent act recognition and response generation. And the pre-training steps are summarized as follows: 1 ) Latent Act Recognition – Given a pair of context and target response, estimate the posterior distribution p( z|c, r ) – Randomly select r− and calculate LRS 2 ) Response Generation – With the sampled latent value z ∼ p( z|c, r ), calculate LNLL and LBOW 3 ) Optimization – Sum up to obtain L, and update network parameters with back-propagation The hyper-parameters used in pre-training are listed as follows. The maximum sequence length of context and response is set to 256 and 50, respectively. The number of transformer blocks in our model L is 12 and the hidden embedding dimension D is 768. The batch size is set to 64 and K is set to 20 for the discrete latent variable. Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) is employed for optimization with a learning rate of 5e - 5 . The pretraining of dialogue generation was carried out on 8 Nvidia Telsa V100 32G GPU cards for 3.5M steps, taking about two weeks to reach convergence. 2.5 Fine-tuning and Inference Our pre-trained model is flexible enough to support various kinds of dialogues, including chit-chat, knowledge grounded conversation, conversational question answering, etc. The fine-tuning on small conversation datasets can be carried out by following the training objectives defined in Equation ( 8 ). As the fine-tuning process reaches convergence, the response towards the given context can be obtained through the following inference procedure: 1 ) Candidate Response Generation – Conditioned on each latent value z ∈ [1,K], generate corresponding candidate response r. 2 ) Response Selection – Calculate the probability for each response p( lr = 1|c, r ) and select the one with highest coherence value as the final response.",

There are three different sizes of training dialogues: 1k, 5k and 9k ( all training data ). The training configurations and experimental results measured with perplexity are summarized in Table 5. There are three groups of pre-trained models : group 1 applies direct fine-tuning of BERT or GPT - 2 ( Radford et al . , 2019 ) on Persona-Chat ; group 2 employs Twitter and Reddit for further training upon the basis of pretrained language models ; group 3 carries out the training process with latent variable .

        "input": "Processing Broadcast Audio for Information Access Abstract This paper addresses recent progress in speaker-independent , large vocabulary , continuous speech recognition , which has opened up a wide range of near and mid-term applications . One rapidly expanding application area is the processing of broadcast audio for information access . At LIMSI , broadcast news transcription systems have been developed for English , French , German , Mandarin and Portuguese , and systems for other languages are under development . Audio indexation must take into account the specificities of audio data , such as needing to deal with the continuous data stream and an imperfect word transcription . Some near-term applications areas are audio data mining , selective dissemination of information and media monitoring . 1 Introduction A major advance in speech processing technology is the ability of todays systems to deal with nonhomogeneous data as is exemplified by broadcast data . With the rapid expansion of different media sources , there is a pressing need for automatic processing of such audio streams . Broadcast audio is challenging as it contains segments of various acoustic and linguistic natures , which require appropriate modeling . A special section in the Communications of the ACM devoted to News on Demand ( Maybury , 2000 ) includes contributions from many of the sites carrying out active research in this area . Via speech recognition , spoken document retrieval ( SDR ) can support random access to relevant portions of audio documents , reducing the time needed to identify recordings in large multimedia databases . The TREC ( Text REtrieval Conference ) SDR evaluation showed that only small differences in information retrieval performance are observed for automatic and manual transcriptions ( Garofolo et al. , 2000 ) .",

        "input": "Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition ( LVCSR ) is a key technology that can be used to enable content-based information access in audio and video documents . Since most of the linguistic information is encoded in the audio channel of video data , which once transcribed can be accessed using text-based tools . This research has been carried out in a multilingual environment in the context of several recent and ongoing European projects . We highlight recent progress in LVCSR and describe some of our work in developing a system for processing broadcast audio for information access . The system has two main components , the speech transcription component and the information retrieval component . Versions of the LIMSI broadcast news transcription system have been developed in American English , French , German , Mandarin and Portuguese . 2 Progress in LVCSR Substantial advances in speech recognition technology have been achieved during the last decade . Only a few years ago speech recognition was primarily associated with small vocabulary isolated word recognition and with speaker-dependent ( often also domain-specific ) dictation systems . The same core technology serves as the basis for a range of applications such as voice-interactive database access or limited-domain dictation , as well as more demanding tasks such as the transcription of broadcast data . With the exception of the inherent variability of telephone channels , for most applications it is reasonable to assume that the speech is produced in relatively stable environmental and in some cases is spoken with the purpose of being recognized by the machine . The ability of systems to deal with nonhomogeneous data as is found in broadcast audio ( changing speakers , languages , backgrounds , topics ) has been enabled by advances in a variety of areas including techniques for robust signal processing and normalization ; improved training techniques which can take advantage of very large audio and textual corpora ; algorithms for audio segmentation ; unsupervised acoustic model adaptation ; efficient decoding with long span language models ; ability to use much larger vocabularies than in the past - 64 k words or more is common to reduce errors due to out-of-vocabulary words .",

        "input": "With the rapid expansion of different media sources for information dissemination including via the internet , there is a pressing need for automatic processing of the audio data stream . The vast majority of audio and video documents that are produced and broadcast do not have associated annotations for indexation and retrieval purposes , and since most of todays annotation methods require substantial manual intervention , and the cost is too large to treat the ever increasing volume of documents . Broadcast audio is challenging to process as it contains segments of various acoustic and linguistic natures , which require appropriate modeling . Transcribing such data requires significantly higher processing power than what is needed to transcribe read speech data in a controlled environment , such as for speaker adapted dictation . Although it is usually assumed that processing time is not a major issue since computer power has been increasing continuously , it is also known that the amount of data appearing on information channels is increasing at a close rate . Therefore processing time is an important factor in making a speech transcription system viable for audio data mining and other related applications . Transcription word error rates of about 20 % have been reported for unrestricted broadcast news data in several languages . As shown in Figure 1 the LIMSI broadcast news transcription system for automatic indexation consists of an audio partitioner and a speech recognizer . 3 Audio partitioning The goal of audio partitioning is to divide the acoustic signal into homogeneous segments , labeling and structuring the acoustic content of the data , and identifying and removing non-speech segments . The LIMSI BN audio partitioner relies on an audio stream mixture model ( Gauvain et al . , 1998 ) .

This information can be used both directly and indirectly for indexation and retrieval purposes . Second , by clustering segments from the same speaker , acoustic model adaptation can be carried out on a per cluster basis , as opposed to on a single segment basis , thus providing more adaptation data . Third , prior segmentation can avoid problems caused by linguistic discontinuity at speaker changes . Fourth , by using acoustic models trained on particular acoustic conditions ( such as wide-band or telephone band ) , overall performance can be significantly improved . Finally , eliminating non-speech segments substantially reduces the computation time . The result of the partitioning process is a set of speech segments usually corresponding to speaker turns with speaker , gender and telephone/wide-band labels ( see Figure 2 ) . 4 Transcription of Broadcast News For each speech segment , the word recognizer determines the sequence of words in the segment , associating start and end times and an optional confidence measure with each word . The LIMSI system , in common with most of todays state-ofthe-art systems , makes use of statistical models of speech generation . From this point of view , message generation is represented by a language model which provides an estimate of the probability of any given word string , and the encoding of the message in the acoustic signal is represented by a probability density function .

The acoustic and language models are trained on large , representative corpora for each task and language . Processing time is an important factor in making a speech transcription system viable for automatic indexation of radio and television broadcasts . For many applications there are limitations on the response time and the available computational resources , which in turn can significantly affect the design of the acoustic and language models . Word recognition is carried out in one or more decoding passes with more accurate acoustic and language models used in successive passes . A 4-gram single pass dynamic network decoder has been developed ( Gauvain and Lamel , 2000 ) which can achieve faster than real-time decoding with a word error under 30 % , running in less than 100 Mb of memory on widely available platforms such Pentium III or Alpha machines . 5 Multilinguality A characteristic of the broadcast news domain is that , at least for what concerns major news events , similar topics are simultaneously covered in different emissions and in different countries and languages . Automatic processing carried out on contemporaneous data sources in different languages can serve for multi-lingual indexation and retrieval . Multilinguality is thus of particular interest for media watch applications , where news may first break in another country or language . At LIMSI broadcast news transcription systems have been developed for the American English , French , German , Mandarin and Portuguese languages . The Mandarin language was chosen because it is quite different from the other languages ( tone and syllable-based ) , and Mandarin resources are available via the LDC as well as reference performance results .",

At the same time , 11,160 of the 12,439 speaker turns occur in the middle of a document , resulting in a false alarm rate of almost 90 % . A more detailed analysis shows that about 50 % of the sections involve a single speaker , but that the distribution of the number of speaker turns per section falls off very gradually ( see Figure 3 ) . False alarms are not as harmful as missed detections , since it may be possible to merge adjacent turns into a single document in subsequent processing . These results show that even perfect speaker turn boundaries can not be used as the primary cue for locating document boundaries .

Our approach yields phrasal and single word lexical paraphrases as well as syntactic paraphrases . 1 Introduction Paraphrases are alternative ways to convey the same information . A method for the automatic acquisition of paraphrases has both practical and linguistic interest . From a practical point of view , diversity in expression presents a major challenge for many NLP applications . In multidocument summarization , identification of paraphrasing is required to find repetitive information in the input documents . In generation , paraphrasing is employed to create more varied and fluent text . Most current applications use manually collected paraphrases tailored to a specific application , or utilize existing lexical resources such as WordNet ( Miller et al . , 1990 ) to identify paraphrases . However , the process of manually collecting paraphrases is time consuming , and moreover , the collection is not reusable in other applications .

        "input": "From a linguistic point of view , questions concern the operative definition of paraphrases : what types of lexical relations and syntactic mechanisms can produce paraphrases ? Many linguists ( Halliday , 1985 ; de Beaugrande and Dressler , 1981 ) agree that paraphrases retain approximate conceptual equivalence , and are not limited only to synonymy relations . But the extent of interchangeability between phrases which form paraphrases is an open question ( Dras , 1999 ) . A corpus-based approach can provide insights on this question by revealing paraphrases that people use . This paper presents a corpus-based method for automatic extraction of paraphrases . We use a large collection of multiple parallel English translations of novels1 . This corpus provides many instances of paraphrasing , because translations preserve the meaning of the original source , but may use different words to convey the meaning . An example of parallel translations is shown in Figure 1 . It contains two pairs of paraphrases : ( burst into tears , cried ) and ( comfort , console ) .

In MT , pairs of translated sentences from a bilingual corpus are aligned , and occurrence patterns of words in two languages in the text are extracted and matched using correlation measures . However , our parallel corpus is far from the clean parallel corpora used in MT. The rendition of a literary text into another language not only includes the translation , but also restructuring of the translation to fit the appropriate literary style . This process introduces differences in the translations which are an intrinsic part of the creative process . This results in greater differences across translations than the differences in typical MT parallel corpora , such as the Canadian Hansards . We will return to this point later in Section 3 .

To automatically infer which contexts are good predictors of paraphrases , contexts surrounding identical words in aligned sentences are extracted and filtered according to their predictive power .

In addition to learning lexical paraphrases , the method also learns syntactic paraphrases , by generalizing syntactic patterns of the extracted paraphrases .

We present results of our evaluation , and conclude with a discussion of our results . 2 Related Work on Paraphrasing Many NLP applications are required to deal with the unlimited variety of human language in expressing the same information . So far , three major approaches of collecting paraphrases have emerged : manual collection , utilization of existing lexical resources and corpus-based extraction of similar words . Manual collection of paraphrases is usually used in generation ( Iordanskaja et al. , 1991 ; Robin , 1994 ) . Paraphrasing is an inevitable part of any generation task , because a semantic concept can be realized in many different ways .

        "input": "Lexical resources are used in statistical generation , summarization and question-answering . The question here is what type of WordNet relations can be considered as paraphrases . In some applications , only synonyms are considered as paraphrases ( Langkilde and Knight , 1998 ) ; in others , looser definitions are used ( Barzilay and Elhadad , 1997 ) . These definitions are valid in the context of particular applications ; however , in general , the correspondence between paraphrasing and types of lexical relations is not clear . The same question arises with automatically constructed thesauri ( Pereira et al. , 1993 ; Lin , 1998 ) . While the extracted pairs are indeed similar , they are not paraphrases . For example , while dog and cat are recognized as the most similar concepts by the method described in ( Lin , 1998 ) , it is hard to imagine a context in which these words would be interchangeable . The first attempt to derive paraphrasing rules from corpora was undertaken by ( Jacquemin et al. , 1997 ) , who investigated morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms . While these rules achieve high accuracy in identifying term paraphrases , the techniques used have not been extended to other types of paraphrasing yet . Statistical techniques were also successfully used by ( Lapata , 2001 ) to identify paraphrases of adjective-noun phrases .",

Specifically , we use literary texts written by foreign authors . Many classical texts have been translated more than once , and these translations are available on-line . In our experiments we used 5 books , among them , Flauberts Madame Bovary , Andersens Fairy Tales and Vernes Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea . Some of the translations were created during different time periods and in different countries . In total , our corpus contains 11 translations 2 . At first glance , our corpus seems quite similar to parallel corpora used by researchers in MT , such as the Canadian Hansards . The major distinction lies in the degree of proximity between the translations . Analyzing multiple translations of the literary texts , critics ( e.g. ( Wechsler , 1998 ) ) have observed that translations are never identical , and each translator creates his own interpretations of the text . Clauses such as adorning his words with puns and saying things to make her smile from the sentences in Figure 1 are examples of distinct translations .",

This characteristic of our corpus is similar to problems with noisy and comparable corpora ( Veronis , 2000 ) , and it prevents us from using methods developed in the MT community based on clean parallel corpora , such as ( Brown et al. , 1993 ) . Another distinction between our corpus and parallel MT corpora is the irregularity of word matchings : in MT , no words in the source language are kept as is in the target language translation ; for example , an English translation of 2Free of copyright restrictions part of our corpus ( 9 translations ) is available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/regina / par . a French source does not contain untranslated French fragments . In contrast , in our corpus the same word is usually used in both translations , and only sometimes its paraphrases are used , which means that wordparaphrase pairs will have lower co-occurrence rates than wordtranslation pairs in MT. For example , consider occurrences of the word boy in two translations of Madame Bovary E. Marx-Avelings translation and Etexts translation . The first text contains 55 occurrences of boy , which correspond to 38 occurrences of boy and 17 occurrences of its paraphrases ( son , young fellow and youngster ) . This rules out using word translation methods based only on word co-occurrence counts . On the other hand , the big advantage of our corpus comes from the fact that parallel translations share many words , which helps the matching process . We describe below a method of paraphrase extraction , exploiting these features of our corpus . 4 Preprocessing During the preprocessing stage , we perform sentence alignment .",

This simple method achieves good results for our corpus , because 42 % of the words in corresponding sentences are identical words on average . Alignment produces 44,562 pairs of sentences with 1,798,526 words . To evaluate the accuracy of the alignment process , we analyzed 127 sentence pairs from the algorithms output . 120 ( 94.5 % ) alignments were identified as correct alignments .

For example , in sentences from Figure 3 , the verbs ringing and sounding do not share identical subject nouns , but the modifier of both subjects Evening is identical . Can we conclude that identical modifiers of the subject imply verb similarity ? To address this question , we need a way to identify contexts that are good predictors for paraphrasing in a corpus .

Identical words play two roles in this process : first , they are used to learn context rules ; second , identical words are used in application of these rules , because the rules contain information about the equality of words in context . This method of co-training has been previously applied to a variety of natural language tasks , such as word sense disambiguation ( Yarowsky , 1995 ) , lexicon construction for information extraction ( Riloff and Jones , 1999 ) , and named entity classification ( Collins and Singer , 1999 ) .

Our model is based on the DLCoTrain algorithm proposed by ( Collins and Singer , 1999 ) , which applies a co-training procedure to decision list classifiers for two independent sets of features . In our case , one set of features describes the paraphrase pair itself , and another set of features corresponds to contexts in which paraphrases occur . These features and their computation are described below . 5.1 Feature Extraction Our paraphrase features include lexical and syntactic descriptions of the paraphrase pair . The lexical feature set consists of the sequence of tokens for each phrase in the paraphrase pair ; the syntactic feature set consists of a sequence of part-of-speech tags where equal words and words with the same root are marked . For example , the value of the syntactic feature for the pair ( the vast chimney , the chimney ) is ( DT JJ NN , DT NN ) , where indices indicate word equalities . We believe that this feature can be useful for two reasons : first , we expect that some syntactic categories can not be paraphrased in another syntactic category .",

Initialization Words which appear in both sentences of an aligned pair are used to create the initial seed rules . Using identical words , we create a set of positive paraphrasing examples , such as word = tried , word = tried . However , training of the classifier demands negative examples as well ; in our case it requires pairs of words in aligned sentences which are not paraphrases of each other .

For example , tried from the first sentence in Figure 1 does not correspond to any other word in the second sentence but tried . Based on this observation , we can derive negative examples such as word = tried , word = Emma and word = tried , word = console .

Training is even harder for transducers that have been assembled via finite-state operations such as composition , minimization , union , concatenation , and closure , as this yields tricky parameter tying . We formulate a parameterized FST paradigm and give training algorithms for it , including a general bookkeeping trick ( expectation semirings ) that cleanly and efficiently computes expectations and gradients . 1 Background and Motivation Rational relations on strings have become widespread in language and speech engineering ( Roche and Schabes , 1997 ) . Despite bounded memory they are well-suited to describe many linguistic and textual processes , either exactly or approximately . A relation is a set of ( input , output ) pairs . Relations are more general than functions because they may pair a given input string with more or fewer than one output string . The class of so-called rational relations admits a nice declarative programming paradigm . Source code describing the relation ( a regular expression ) is compiled into efficient object code ( in the form of a 2 - tape automaton called a finite-state transducer ) . The object code can even be optimized for runtime and code size ( via algorithms such as determinization and minimization of transducers ) . This programming paradigm supports efficient nondeterminism , including parallel processing over infinite sets of input strings , and even allows reverse computation from output to input .",

        "input": "Its unusual flexibility for the practiced programmer stems from the many operations under which rational relations are closed . It is common to define further useful operations ( as macros ) , which modify existing relations not by editing their source code but simply by operating on them from outside . A brief version of this work , with some additional material , first appeared as ( Eisner , 2001a ) . A leisurely journal-length version with more details has been prepared and is available . The entire paradigm has been generalized to weighted relations , which assign a weight to each ( input , output ) pair rather than simply including or excluding it . If these weights represent probabilities P ( input , output ) or P ( output | input ) , the weighted relation is called a joint or conditional ( probabilistic ) relation and constitutes a statistical model . Such models can be efficiently restricted , manipulated or combined using rational operations as before . An artificial example will appear in 2 . The availability of toolkits for this weighted case ( Mohri et al. , 1998 ; van Noord and Gerdemann , 2001 ) promises to unify much of statistical NLP . Such tools make it easy to run most current approaches to statistical markup , chunking , normalization , segmentation , alignment , and noisy-channel decoding , ' including classic models for speech recognition ( Pereira and Riley , 1997 ) and machine translation ( Knight and Al-Onaizan , 1998 ) .",

Unfortunately , there is a stumbling block : Where do the weights come from ? After all , statistical models require supervised or unsupervised training . Currently , finite-state practitioners derive weights using exogenous training methods , then patch them onto transducer arcs . Not only do these methods require additional programming outside the toolkit , but they are limited to particular kinds of models and training regimens . For example , the forward-backward algorithm ( Baum , 1972 ) trains only Hidden Markov Models , while ( Ristad and Yianilos , 1996 ) trains only stochastic edit distance . In short , current finite-state toolkits include no training algorithms , because none exist for the large space of statistical models that the toolkits can in principle describe and run . ` Given output , find input to maximize P ( input , output ) . This paper aims to provide a remedy through a new paradigm , which we call parameterized finitestate machines .

If f ( input , output ) is a weighted regular relation , then the following statements are equivalent : ( 1 ) f is a joint probabilistic relation ; ( 2 ) f can be computed by a Markovian FST that halts with probability 1 ; ( 3 ) f can be expressed as a probabilistic regexp , i.e . , a regexp built up from atomic expressions a : b ( for a E E U { E } , b E A U { E } ) using concatenation , probabilistic union + p , and probabilistic closure * p . For defining conditional relations , a good regexp language is unknown to us , but they can be defined in several other ways : ( 1 ) via FSTs as in Fig . 1c , ( 2 ) by compilation of weighted rewrite rules ( Mohri and Sproat , 1996 ) , ( 3 ) by compilation of decision trees ( Sproat and Riley , 1996 ) , ( 4 ) as a relation that performs contextual left-to-right replacement of input substrings by a smaller conditional relation ( Gerdemann and van Noord , 1999 ) , 5 ( 5 ) by conditionalization of a joint relation as discussed below . A central technique is to define a joint relation as a noisy-channel model , by composing a joint relation with a cascade of one or more conditional relations as in Fig . 1 ( Pereira and Riley , 1997 ; Knight and Graehl , 1998 ) . The general form is illustrated by 3Conceptually , the parameters represent the probabilities of reading another a ( A ) ; reading another b ( ) ; transducing b to p rather than q ( ) ; starting to transduce p to a rather than x ( p ) . P ( v , z ) def = Ew , x , y P ( v | w ) P ( w , x ) P ( y | x ) P ( z | y ) , implemented by composing 4 machines . There are also procedures for defining weighted FSTs that are not probabilistic ( Berstel and Reutenauer , 1988 ) . Arbitrary weights such as 2.7 may be assigned to arcs or sprinkled through a regexp ( to be compiled into E : E/2 .7 ) arcs ) . A more subtle example is weighted FSAs that approximate PCFGs ( Nederhof , 2000 ; Mohri and Nederhof , 2001 ) , or to extend the idea , weighted FSTs that approximate joint or conditional synchronous PCFGs built for translation .",

To implement the joint case , just divide stopping weights by the total weight of all paths ( which 4 shows how to find ) , provided this is finite . In the conditional case , let g be a copy of f with the output labels removed , so that g ( x ) finds the desired divisor ; determinize g if possible ( but this fails for some weighted FSAs ) , replace all weights with their reciprocals , and compose the result with f . 9 6 P ( w , x ) defines the source model , and is often an identity FST that requires w = x , really just an FSA . 7We propose also using n-tape automata to generalize to branching noisy channels ( a case of dendroid distributions ) . In Ew , x P ( v | w ) P ( v , | w ) P ( w , x ) P ( y | x ) , the true transcription w can be triply constrained by observing speech y and two errorful transcriptions v , v ' , which independently depend on w. 8A corresponding problem exists in the joint case , but may be easily avoided there by first pruning non-coaccessible states . 9It suffices to make g unambiguous ( one accepting path per string ) , a weaker condition than determinism . When this is not possible ( as in the inverse of Fig . 1b , whose conditionalization can not be realized by any weighted FST ) , one can sometimes succeed by first intersecting g with a smaller regular set in which the input being considered is known to fall . Normalization is particularly important because it enables the use of log-linear ( maximum-entropy ) parameterizations . Here one defines each arc weight , coin weight , or regexp weight in terms of meaningful features associated by hand with that arc , coin , etc. . Each feature has a strength E R > 0 , and a weight is computed as the product of the strengths of its features .10 It is now the strengths that are the learnable parameters .

This mapping from abstract representation to surface string can be direct , or it can employ intermediate syntactic representations which significantly constrain the output . Furthermore , the mapping can be performed purely by rules , by application of statistical models , or by a combination of both techniques . Among the systems that use statistical or machine learned techniques in sentence realization , there are various degrees of intermediate syntactic structure . Nitrogen ( Langkilde and Knight , 1998a , 1998b ) produces a large set of alternative surface realizations of an input structure ( which can vary in abstractness ) . This set of candidate surface strings , represented as a word lattice , is then rescored by a word-bigram language model , to produce the bestranked output sentence . FERGUS ( Bangalore and Rambow , 2000 ) , on the other hand , employs a model of syntactic structure during sentence realization . In simple terms , it adds a tree-based stochastic model to the approach taken by the Nitrogen system . This tree-based model chooses a best-ranked XTAG representation for a given dependency structure . Possible linearizations of the XTAG representation are generated and then evaluated by a language model to pick the best possible linearization , as in Nitrogen .",

The contexts for most of these operations in Amalgam are machine learned . The resulting syntactic tree contains all the necessary information on its leaf nodes from which a surface string can be read . The goal of this paper is to show that it is possible to learn accurately the contexts for linguistically complex operations in sentence realization . We propose that learning the contexts for the application of these linguistic operations can be viewed as per-operation classification problems . This approach combines advantages of a linguistically informed approach to sentence realization with the advantages of a machine Abstract We show that it is possible to learn the contexts for linguistic operations which map a semantic representation to a surface syntactic tree in sentence realization with high accuracy . We cast the problem of learning the contexts for the linguistic operations as classification tasks , and apply straightforward machine learning techniques , such as decision tree learning . The training data consist of linguistic features extracted from syntactic and semantic representations produced by a linguistic analysis system .

To substantiate our claim , we provide four examples from Amalgam : assignment of case , assignment of verb position features , extraposition , and syntactic aggregation . 2 Overview of Amalgam Amalgam takes as its input a sentence-level semantic graph representation with fixed lexical choices for content words ( the logical form graph of the NLPWin system see ( Heidorn , 2000 ) ) . This representation is first degraphed into a tree , and then gradually augmented by the insertion of function words , assignment of case and verb position features , syntactic labels , etc. , and transformed into a syntactic surface tree .

Most descriptive accounts of German syntax are based on a topology of the German sentence that treats the position of the verb as the fixed frame around which other syntactic constituents are organized in relatively free order ( cf. Eisenberg , 1999 ; Engel , 1996 ) . The position of the verb in German is non-negotiable ; errors in the positioning of the verb result in gibberish , whereas most permutations of other constituents only result in less fluent output . Depending on the position of the finite verb , German sentences and verb phrases are classified as being verb-initial , verb-second or verbfinal .

Both extraposed and non-extraposed versions of a sentence are acceptable , with varying degrees of fluency .

In the technical domain , more than one third of German relative clauses are extraposed , as compared to a meagre 0.22 % of English relative clauses . In encyclopaedia text ( Microsoft Encarta ) , approximately every fifth German relative clause is extraposed , compared to only 0.3 % of English relative clauses . For complement clauses and infinitival clauses , the differences are not as striking , but still significant : in the technical and encyclopaedia domains , extraposition of infinitival and complement clauses in German ranges from 1.5 % to 3.2 % , whereas English only shows a range from 0 % to 0.53 % . We chose to model extraposition as an iterative movement process from the original attachment site to the next higher node in the tree ( for an alternative one-step solution and a comparison of the two approaches see ( Gamon et al. , 2002a ) ) . The target feature of the model is the answer to the yes/no question Should the clause move from node X to the parent of node X ? . 6.1 Features in the extraposition model The tendency of a clause to be extraposed depends on properties of both the clause itself ( e.g. , some notion of heaviness ) and the current attachment site . Very coarse linguistic generalizations are that a relative clause tends to be extraposed if it is sufficiently heavy and if it is followed by verbal material in the same clause . Feature extraction for this model reflects that fact by taking into consideration features on the extraposition candidate , the current attachment site , and potential next higher landing site . This results in a total of 1168 features . Each node in the parent chain of an extraposable clause , up to the actual attachment node , constitutes a single data point During the decision tree building process , 60 features were selected as predictive .",

In other words , the target node for extraposition is the highest node in the parent chain for which the answer to the classification task Should the clause move from node X to the parent of node X ? is yes with no interceding no answer . The prediction of the model was compared with the actual observed attachment site of the extraposable clause to yield the accuracy figures shown in Table 3 . The model has 116 branching nodes . The baseline for this task is calculated by applying the most frequent value for the target feature ( do n't move ) to all nodes . The baseline for extraposition of infinitival and complement clauses is very high . The number of extraposed clauses of both types in the test set ( fifteen extraposed infinitival clauses and twelve extraposed complement clauses ) is very small , so it comes as no surprise that the model accuracy ranges around the baseline for these two types of extraposed clauses . 7 Syntactic aggregation Any sentence realization component that generates from an abstract semantic representation and strives to produce fluent output beyond simple templates will have to deal with coordination and the problem of duplicated material in coordination . This is generally viewed as a subarea of aggregation in the generation literature ( Wilkinson , 1995 ; Shaw , 1998 ; Reape and Mellish , 1999 ; Dalianis and Hovy , 1993 ) . In Amalgam , the approach we take is strictly intrasentential , along the lines of what has been called conjunction reduction in the linguistic literature ( McCawley , 1988 ) .

Mediated by an XML-based multi-layer annotation architecture , we interleave a robust , but accurate stochastic topological field parser of German with a constraintbased HPSG parser . Our annotation-based method for dovetailing shallow and deep phrasal constraints is highly flexible , allowing targeted and fine-grained guidance of constraint-based parsing . We conduct systematic experiments that demonstrate substantial performance gains .1 1 Introduction One of the strong points of deep processing ( DNLP ) technology such as HPSG or LFG parsers certainly lies with the high degree of precision as well as detailed linguistic analysis these systems are able to deliver . Although considerable progress has been made in the area of processing speed , DNLP systems still can not rival shallow and medium depth technologies in terms of throughput and robustness . As a net effect , the impact of deep parsing technology on application-oriented NLP is still fairly limited . With the advent of XML-based hybrid shallowdeep architectures as presented in ( Grover and Lascarides , 2001 ; Crysmann et al. , 2002 ; Uszkoreit , 2002 ) it has become possible to integrate the added value of deep processing with the performance and robustness of shallow processing . So far , integration has largely focused on the lexical level , to improve upon the most urgent needs in increasing the robustness and coverage of deep parsing systems , namely lexical coverage . While integration in ( Grover and Lascarides , 2001 ) was still restricted to morphological and PoS information , ( Crysmann et al. , 2002 ) extended shallow-deep integration at the lexical level to lexico-semantic information , and named entity expressions , including multiword expressions . ( Crysmann et al. , 2002 ) assume a vertical , pipeline scenario where shallow NLP tools provide XML annotations that are used by the DNLP system as a preprocessing and lexical interface . The perspective opened up by a multi-layered , data-centric architecture is , however , much broader , in that it encourages horizontal cross-fertilisation effects among complementary and/or competing components .",

In this paper , we will thus complement the efforts made on the lexical side by integration at the phrasal level . We will show that this may lead to considerable performance increase for the DNLP component . More specifically , we combine a probabilistic topological field parser for German ( Becker and Frank , 2002 ) with the HPSG parser of ( Callmeier , 2000 ) . The HPSG grammar used is the one originally developed by ( Muller and Kasper , 2000 ) , with significant performance enhancements by B . Crysmann .

Section 7 concludes and discusses possible extensions , to address robustness issues . 2 Integrated Shallow and Deep Processing The prime motivation for integrated shallow-deep processing is to combine the robustness and efficiency of shallow processing with the accuracy and fine-grainedness of deep processing . Shallow analyses could be used to pre-structure the search space of a deep parser , enhancing its efficiency . Even if deep analysis fails , shallow analysis could act as a guide to select partial analyses from the deep parsers chart enhancing the robustness of deep analysis , and the informativeness of the combined system . In this paper , we concentrate on the usage of shallow information to increase the efficiency , and potentially the quality , of HPSG parsing . In particular , we want to use analyses delivered by an efficient shallow parser to pre-structure the search space of HPSG parsing , thereby enhancing its efficiency , and guiding deep parsing towards a best-first analysis suggested by shallow analysis constraints . The search space of an HPSG chart parser can be effectively constrained by external knowledge sources if these deliver compatible partial subtrees , which would then only need to be checked for compatibility with constituents derived in deep parsing . Raw constituent span information can be used to guide the parsing process by penalizing constituents which are incompatible with the precomputed shape . Additional information about proposed constituents , such as categorial or featural constraints , provide further criteria for prioritising compatible , and penalising incompatible constituents in the deep parsers chart . An obvious challenge for our approach is thus to identify suitable shallow knowledge sources that can deliver compatible constraints for HPSG parsing . 2.1 The Shallow-Deep Mapping Problem However , chunks delivered by state-of-the-art shallow parsers are not isomorphic to deep syntactic analyses that explicitly encode phrasal embedding structures .",

They are thus easily trapped in cases such as ( 2 ) . In sum , state-of-the-art chunk parsing does neither provide sufficient detail , nor the required accuracy to act as a guide for deep syntactic analysis . 2.2 Stochastic Topological Parsing Recently , there is revived interest in shallow analyses that determine the clausal macro-structure of sentences . The topological field model of ( German ) syntax ( Hohle , 1983 ) divides basic clauses into distinct fields pre - , middle - , and post-fields delimited by verbal or sentential markers , which constitute the left / right sentence brackets . This model of clause structure is underspecified , or partial as to non-sentential constituent structure , but provides a theory-neutral model of sentence macro-structure . Due to its linguistic underpinning , the topological field model provides a pre-partitioning of complex sentences that is ( i ) highly compatible with deep syntactic analysis , and thus ( ii ) maximally effective to increase parsing efficiency if interleaved with deep syntactic analysis ; ( iii ) partiality regarding the constituency of non-sentential material ensures robustness , coverage , and processing efficiency . ( Becker and Frank , 2002 ) explored a corpusbased stochastic approach to topological field parsing , by training a non-lexicalised PCFG on a topological corpus derived from the NEGRA treebank of German . Measured on the basis of hand-corrected PoS-tagged input as provided by the NEGRA treebank , the parser achieves 100 % coverage for length < 40 ( 99.8 % for all ) .

These properties , along with their high accuracy rate , make them perfect candidates for tight integration with deep syntactic analysis .

In Figure 1 , e.g . , the span from the verb hatte to the end of the sentence forms a constituent in the HPSG analysis , while in the topological tree the same span is dominated by a sequence of categories : LK , MF , RK , NF . Yet , due to its linguistic underpinning , the topological tree can be used to systematically predict key constituents in the corresponding target HPSG 2See Section 6 for comparison to recent work on integrated chunk-based and dependency parsing in ( Daum et al . , 2003 ) . 3As , for example , in ( Duchier and Debusmann , 2001 ) . analysis . We know , for example , that the span from the fronted verb ( LK-VFIN ) till the end of its clause CL-V2 corresponds to an HPSG phrase . Also , the first position that follows this verb , here the leftmost daughter of MF , demarcates the left edge of the traditional VP . Spans of the vorfeld VF and clause categories CL exactly match HPSG constituents . Category CL-V2 tells us that we need to reckon with a fronted verb in position of its LK daughter , here 3 , while in CL-SUBCL we expect a complementiser in the position of LK , and a finite verb within the right verbal complex RK , which spans positions 12 to 13 . In order to communicate such structural constraints to the deep parser , we scan the topological tree for relevant configurations , and extract the span information for the target HPSG constituents . The resulting map constraints ( Fig. 1 ) encode a bracket type name4 that identifies the target constituent and its left and right boundary , i.e. the concrete span in the sentence under consideration . The span is encoded by the word position index in the input , which is identical for the two parsing processes .5 In addition to pure constituency constraints , a skilled grammar writer will be able to associate specific HPSG grammar constraints positive or negative with these bracket types .",

Section 4 ) is communicated to the deep parser by way of an XML interface . 3.2 Annotation-based Integration In the annotation-based architecture of ( Crysmann et al. , 2002 ) , XML-encoded analysis results of all components are stored in a multi-layer XML chart . The architecture employed in this paper improves on ( Crysmann et al . , 2002 ) by providing a central Whiteboard Annotation Transformer ( WHAT ) that supports flexible and powerful access to and transformation of XML annotation based on standard XSLT engines6 ( see ( Schafer , 2003 ) for more details on WHAT ) . Shallow-deep integration is thus fully annotation driven . Complex XSLT transformations are applied to the various analyses , in order to extract or combine independent knowledge sources , including XPath access to information stored in shallow annotation , complex XSLT transformations to the output of the topological parser , and extraction of bracket constraints . 3.3 Shaping the Deep Parser’s Search Space The HPSG parser is an active bidirectional chart parser which allows flexible parsing strategies by using an agenda for the parsing tasks .7 To compute priorities for the tasks , several information sources can be consulted , e.g . the estimated quality of the participating edges or external resources like PoS tagger results . Object-oriented implementation of the priority computation facilitates exchange and , moreover , combination of different ranking strategies . Extending our current regime that uses PoS tagging for prioritisation , 8 we are now utilising phrasal constraints ( brackets ) from topological analysis to enhance the hand-crafted parsing heuristic employed so far . Conditions for changing default priorities Every bracket pair brx computed from the topological analysis comes with a bracket type x that defines its behaviour in the priority computation . Each bracket type can be associated with a set of positive and negative constraints that state a set of permissible or forbidden rules and / or feature structure configurations for the HPSG analysis .",

A rightmatching bracket may affect the priority of tasks whose resulting edge will end at the right bracket of a pair , like , for example , a task that would combine edges C and F or C and D in Fig. 2 . Left-matching brackets work analogously . For fully matching brackets , only tasks that produce an edge that matches the span of the bracket pair can be affected , like , e.g. , a task that combines edges B and C in Fig. 2 . If , in addition , specified rule as well as feature structure constraints hold , the task is rewarded if they are positive constraints , and penalised if they are negative ones . All tasks that produce crossing edges , i.e. where one endpoint lies strictly inside the bracket pair and the other lies strictly outside , are penalised , e.g. , a task that combines edges A and B . This behaviour can be implemented efficiently when we assume that the computation of a task pri ority takes into account the priorities of the tasks it builds upon . This guarantees that the effect of changing one task in the parsing process will propagate to all depending tasks without having to check the bracket conditions repeatedly . For each task , it is sufficient to examine the startand endpoints of the building edges to determine if its priority is affected by some bracket .

Sec. 4 will introduce these measures . The priority p ( t ) of a task t involving a bracket brx is computed from the default priority p ( t ) by : 4 Confidence Measures This way of calculating priorities allows flexible parameterisation for the integration of bracket constraints . While the topological parsers accuracy is high , we need to reckon with ( partially ) wrong analyses that could counter the expected performance gains . An important factor is therefore the confidence we can have , for any new sentence , into the best parse delivered by the topological parser : If confidence is high , we want it to be fully considered for prioritisation if it is low , we want to lower its impact , or completely ignore the proposed brackets . We will experiment with two alternative confidence measures : ( i ) expected accuracy of particular bracket types extracted from the best parse delivered , and ( ii ) tree entropy based on the probability distribution encountered in a topological parse , as a measure of the overall accuracy of the best parse proposed and thus the extracted brackets .9 4.1 Confpr: Accuracy of map-constraints To determine a measure of expected accuracy for the map constraints , we computed precision and recall for the 34 bracket types by comparing the extracted brackets from the suite of best delivered topological parses against the brackets we extracted from the trees in the manually annotated evaluation corpus in ( Becker and Frank , 2002 ) .

It is a useful measure to assess how certain the parser is about the best analysis , e.g. to measure the training utility value of a data point in the context of sample selection ( Hwa , 2000 ) . We thus employ tree entropy as a confidence measure for the quality of the best topological parse , and the extracted bracket constraints . We carry out an experiment to assess the effect of varying entropy thresholds 0 on precision and recall of topological parsing , in terms of perfect match rate , and show a way to determine an optimal value for 0 . We compute tree entropy over the full probability distribution , and normalise the values to be distributed in a range between 0 and 1 . The normalisation factor is empirically determined as the highest entropy over all sentences of the training set .10 Experimental setup We randomly split the manually corrected evaluation corpus of ( Becker and Frank , 2002 ) ( for sentence length < 40 ) into a training set of 600 sentences and a test set of 408 sentences . This yields the following values for the training set ( test set in brackets ) : initial perfect match rate is 73.5 % ( 70.0 % ) , LP 88.8 % ( 87.6 % ) , and LR 88.5 % ( 87.8 % ) .11 Coverage is 99.8 % for both . Evaluation measures For the task of identifying the perfect matches from a set of parses we give the following standard definitions : precision is the proportion of selected parses that have a perfect match thus being the perfect match rate , and recall is the proportion of perfect matches that the system selected . Coverage is usually defined as the proportion of attempted analyses with at least one parse . We extend this definition to treat successful analyses with a high tree entropy as being out of coverage .",

As baseline , we performed a run without topological information , yet including PoS prioritisation from tagging .13 A series of tests explores the effects of alternative parameter settings . We further test the impact of chunk information . To this end , phrasal fields determined by topological parsing were fed to the chunk parser of ( Skut and Brants , 1998 ) . Extracted NP and PP bracket constraints are defined as left-matching bracket types , to compensate for the non-embedding structure of chunks . Chunk brackets are tested in conjunction with topological brackets , and in isolation , using the labelled precision value of 71.1 % in ( Skut and Brants , 1998 ) as a uniform confidence weight .14 Measures For all runs we measure the absolute time and the number of parsing tasks needed to compute the first reading . The times in the individual runs were normalised according to the number of executed tasks per second . We noticed that the coverage of some integrated runs decreased by up to 1 % of the 5060 test items , with a typical loss of around 0.5 % . To warrant that we are not just trading coverage for speed , we derived two measures from the primary data : an upper bound , where we associated every unsuccessful parse with the time and number of tasks used when the limit of 70000 passive edges was hit , and a lower bound , where we removed the most expensive parses from each run , until we reached the same coverage .",

Setting y to 12 without using any confidence measure causes the priority of every affected parsing task to be in - or decreased by half its value . Setting y to 1 drastically increases the influence of topological information , the priority for rewarded tasks is doubled and set to zero for penalized ones .

Thresholded entropy ET yields slightly lower gains . This could be due to a non-optimal threshold , or the fact that while precision differentiates bracket types in terms of their confidence , such that only a small number of brackets are weakened tree entropy as a global measure penalizes all brackets for a sentence on an equal basis , neutralizing positive effects which as seen in + / P may still contribute useful information . Additional use of chunk brackets ( row 10 ) leads to a slight decrease , probably due to lower precision of chunk brackets . Even more , isolated use of chunk information ( row 11 ) does not yield signifi cant gains over the baseline ( 0.89 / 1.1 ) . Similar results were reported in ( Daum et al. , 2003 ) for integration of chunk - and dependency parsing .15 For PT - E ( yz , Figure 5 shows substantial performance gains , with some outliers in the range of length 2536 . 962 sentences ( length A , avg . 11.09 ) took longer parse time as compared to the baseline ( with 5 % variance margin ) . For coverage losses , we isolated two factors : while erroneous topological information could lead the parser astray , we also found cases where topological information prevented spurious HPSG parses to surface . This suggests that the integrated system bears the potential of crossvalidation of different components . 7 Conclusion We demonstrated that integration of shallow topological and deep HPSG processing results in significant performance gains , of factor 2.25 at a high level of deep parser efficiency .

Our system deals with pronouns with NPand non-NP-antecedents . We present a set of features designed for pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue and determine the most promising features . We evaluate the system on twenty Switchboard dialogues and show that it compares well to Byrons ( 2002 ) manually tuned system . 1 Introduction Corpus-based methods and machine learning techniques have been applied to anaphora resolution in written text with considerable success ( Soon et al. , 2001 ; Ng & Cardie , 2002 , among others ) . It has been demonstrated that systems based on these approaches achieve a performance that is comparable to hand-crafted systems . Since they can easily be applied to new domains it seems also feasible to port a given corpus-based anaphora resolution system from written text to spoken dialogue . This paper describes the extensions and adaptations needed for applying our anaphora resolution system ( Muller et al. , 2002 ; Strube et al. , 2002 ) to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue . There are important differences between written text and spoken dialogue which have to be accounted for . The most obvious difference is that in spoken dialogue there is an abundance of ( personal and demonstrative ) pronouns with non-NP-antecedents or no antecedents at all . Corpus studies have shown that a significant amount of pronouns in spoken dialogue have non-NP-antecedents : Byron & Allen ( 1998 ) report that about 50 % of the pronouns in the TRAINS93 corpus have non-NP-antecedents .",

        "input": "Eckert & Strube ( 2000 ) note that only about 45 % of the pronouns in a set of Switchboard dialogues have NP-antecedents . The remainder consists of 22 % which have non-NP-antecedents and 33 % without antecedents . These studies suggest that the performance of a pronoun resolution algorithm can be improved considerably by enabling it to resolve also pronouns with non-NP-antecedents . Because of the difficulties a pronoun resolution algorithm encounters in spoken dialogue , previous approaches were applied only to tiny domains , they needed deep semantic analysis and discourse processing and relied on hand-crafted knowledge bases . In contrast , we build on our existing anaphora resolution system and incrementally add new features specifically devised for spoken dialogue . That way we are able to determine relatively powerful yet computationally cheap features . To our knowledge the work presented here describes the first implemented system for corpus-based anaphora resolution dealing also with non-NP-antecedents . 2 NP- vs. Non-NP-Antecedents Spoken dialogue contains more pronouns with nonNP-antecedents than written text does . However , pronouns with NP-antecedents ( like 3rd pers . masculine / feminine pronouns , cf . he in the example below ) still constitute the largest fraction of all coreferential pronouns in the Switchboard corpus . In spoken dialogue there are considerable numbers of pronouns that pick up different kinds of abstract objects from the previous discourse , e.g. events , states , concepts , propositions or facts ( Webber , 1991 ; Asher , 1993 ) .",

These facts have to be kept in mind when comparing our results to results of coreference resolution in written text . 3.2 Data Generation Training and test data instances were generated from our corpus as follows . All markables were sorted in document order , and markables for first and second person pronouns were removed . The resulting list was then processed from top to bottom . If the list contained an NP-markable at the current position and if this markable was not an indefinite noun phrase , it was considered a potential anaphor . In that case , pairs of potentially coreferring expressions were generated by combining the potential anaphor with each compatible1 NP-markable preceding2 it in the list . The resulting pairs were labelled P if both markables had the same ( non-empty ) value in their member attribute , N otherwise . For anaphors with non-NP-antecedents , additional training and test data instances had to be generated .",

In that case , a small set of potential non-NP-antecedents was generated by selecting S - and VP-markables from the last two valid sentences preceding the potential anaphor .

A sentence was considered valid if it was neither unfinished nor a backchannel utterance ( like e.g. Uh-huh , Yeah , etc. ) . From the selected markables , inaccessible non-NP-expressions were automatically removed . We considered an expression inaccessible if it ended before the sentence in which it was contained . This was intended to be a rough approximation of the concept of the right frontier ( Webber , 1991 ) . The remaining expressions were then combined with the potential anaphor . Finally , the resulting pairs were labelled P or N and added to the instances generated with NP-antecedents . 4 Features We distinguish two classes of features : NP-level features specify e.g. the grammatical function , NP form , morpho-syntax , grammatical case and the depth of embedding in the syntactical structure .",

Byron extends a pronoun resolution algorithm ( Tetrault , 2001 ) with semantic filtering , thus enabling it to resolve anaphors with non-NPantecedents as well . Semantic filtering relies on knowledge about semantic restrictions associated with verbs , like semantic compatibility between subject and predicative noun or predicative adjective . An evaluation on ten TRAINS93 dialogues with 80 3rd person pronouns and 100 demonstrative pronouns shows that semantic filtering and the implementation of different search strategies for personal and demonstrative pronouns yields a success rate of 72 % .

This simplifies the task considerably . 7 Conclusions and Future Work We presented a machine learning approach to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue . We built upon a system we used for anaphora resolution in written text and extended it with a set of features designed for spoken dialogue . We refined distance features and used metrics from information retrieval for determining non-NP-antecedents . Inspired by the more linguistically oriented work by Eckert & Strube ( 2000 ) and Byron ( 2002 ) we also evaluated the contribution of features which used the predicative context of the pronoun to be resolved . However , these features did not show up in the final models since they did not lead to an improvement . Instead , rather simple distance metrics were preferred . While we were ( almost ) satisfied with the performance of these features , the major problem for a spoken dialogue pronoun resolution algorithm is the abundance of pronouns without antecedents . Previous research could avoid dealing with this phenomenon by either applying the algorithm by hand ( Eckert & Strube , 2000 ) or excluding these cases ( Byron , 2002 ) from the evaluation . Because we included these cases in our evaluation we consider our approach at least comparable to Byrons system when she uses only domain-independent semantics .",

        "input": "Constructivist Development of Grounded Construction Grammars SONY Computer Science Lab - Paris 6 Rue Amyot, 75005 Paris steels@arti.vub.ac.be Abstract The paper reports on progress in building computational models of a constructivist approach to language development . It introduces a formalism for construction grammars and learning strategies based on invention , abduction , and induction . Examples are drawn from experiments exercising the model in situated language games played by embodied artificial agents . 1 Introduction The constructivist approach to language learning proposes that children acquire linguistic competence ( ... ) only gradually , beginning with more concrete linguistic structures based on particular words and morphemes , and then building up to more abstract and productive structures based on various types of linguistic categories , schemas , and constructions . ( TomaselloBrooks , 1999 ) , p. 161 . The approach furthermore assumes that language development is ( i ) grounded in cognition because prior to ( or in a co-development with language ) there is an understanding and conceptualisation of scenes in terms of events , objects , roles that objects play in events , and perspectives on the event , and ( ii ) grounded in communication because language learning is intimately embedded in interactions with specific communicative goals . In contrast to the nativist position , defended , for example , by Pinker ( Pinker , 1998 ) , the constructivist approach does not assume that the semantic and syntactic categories as well as the linking rules ( specifying for example that the agent of an action is linked to the subject of a sentence ) are universal and innate . Rather , semantic and syntactic categories as well as the way they are linked is built up in a gradual developmental process , starting from quite specific verb-island constructions . Although the constructivist approach appears to explain a lot of the known empirical data about child language acquisition , there is so far no worked out model that details how constructivist language development works concretely , i.e. what kind of computational mechanisms are implied and how they work together to achieve adult ( or even child ) level competence . Moreover only little work has been done so far to build computational models for handling the sort of construction grammars assumed by this approach . Both challenges inform the research discussed in this paper . 2 Abductive Learning In the constructivist literature , there is often the implicit assumption that grammatical development is the result of observational learning , and several research efforts are going on to operationalise this approach for acquiring grounded lexicons and grammars ( see e.g. ( Roy , 2001 ) ) . The agents are given pairs with a real world situation , as perceived by the sensori-motor apparatus , and a language utterance .",

        "input": "For example , an image of a ball is shown and at the same time a stretch of speech containing the word ball . Based on a generalisation process that uses statistical pattern recognition algorithms or neural networks , the learner then gradually extracts what is common between the various situations in which the same word or construction is used , thus progressively building a grounded lexicon and grammar of a language . The observational learning approach has had some success in learning words for objects and acquiring simple grammatical constructions , but there seem to be two inherent limitations . First , there is the well known poverty of the stimulus argument , widely accepted in linguistics , which says that there is not enough data in the sentences normally available to the language learner to arrive at realistic lexicons and grammars , let alone learn at the same time the categorisations and conceptualisations of the world implied by the language . This has lead many linguists to adopt the nativist position mentioned earlier . The nativist position could in principle be integrated in an observational learning framework by introducing strong biases on the generalisation process , incorporating the constraints of universal grammar , but it has been difficult to identify and operationalise enough of these constraints to do concrete experiments in realistic settings . Second , observational learning assumes that the language system ( lexicon and grammar ) exists as a fixed static system . However , observations of language in use shows that language users constantly align their language conventions to suit the purposes of specific conversations ( ClarkBrennan , 1991 ) . Natural languages therefore appear more to be like complex adaptive systems , similar to living systems that constantly adapt and evolve . This makes it difficult to rely exclusively on statistical generalisation .",

        "input": "It does not capture the inherently creative nature of language use . This paper explores an alternative approach , which assumes a much more active stance from language users based on the Peircian notion of abduction ( Fann , 1970 ) . The speaker first attempts to use constructions from his existing inventory to express whatever he wants to express . However when that fails or is judged unsatisfactory , the speaker may extend his existing repertoire by inventing new constructions . These new constructions should be such that there is a high chance that the hearer may be able to guess their meaning . The hearer also uses as much as possible constructions stored in his own inventory to make sense of what is being said . But when there are unknown constructions , or the meanings do not fit with the situation being talked about , the hearer makes an educated guess about what the meaning of the unknown language constructions could be , and adds them as new hypotheses to his own inventory . Abductive constructivist learning hence relies crucially on the fact that both agents have sufficient common ground , share the same situation , have established joint attention , and share communicative goals . Both speaker and hearer use themselves as models of the other in order to guess how the other one will interpret a sentence or why the speaker says things in a particular way . Because both speaker and hearer are taking risks making abductive leaps , a third activity is needed , namely induction , not in the sense of statistical generalisation as in observational learning but in the sense of Peirce ( Fann , 1970 ) : A hypothesis arrived at by making educated guesses is tested against further data coming from subsequent interactions .",

        "input": "When a construction leads to a successful interaction , there is some evidence that this construction is ( or could become ) part of the set of conventions adopted by the group , and language users should therefore prefer it in the future . When the construction fails , the language user should avoid it if alternatives are available . Implementing these visions of language learning and use is obviously an enormous challenge for computational linguistics . It requires not only cognitive and communicative grounding , but also grammar formalisms and associated parsing and production algorithms which are extremely flexible , both from the viewpoint of getting as far as possible in the interpretation or production process despite missing rules or incompatibilities in the inventories of speaker and hearer , and from the viewpoint of supporting continuous change . 3 Language Games The research reported here uses a methodological approach which is quite common in Artificial Life research but still relatively novel in ( computational ) linguistics : Rather than attempting to develop simulations that generate natural phenomena directly , as one does when using Newtons equations to simulate the trajectory of a ball falling from a tower , we engage in computational simulations and robotic experiments that create ( new ) artificial phenomena that have some of the characteristics of natural phenomena and hence are seen as explaining them . Specifically , we implement artificial agents with components modeling certain cognitive operations ( such as introducing a new syntactic category , computing an analogy between two events , etc. ) , and then see what language phenomena result if these agents exercise these components in embodied situated language games . This way we can investigate very precisely what causal factors may underly certain phenomena and can focus on certain aspects of ( grounded ) language use without having to face the vast full complexity of real human languages . A survey of work which follows a similar methodology is found in ( CangelosiParisi , 2003 ) . The artificial agents used in the experiments driving our research observe real-world scenes through their cameras . The scenes consist of interactions between puppets , as shown in figure 1 . These scenes enact common events like movement of people and objects , actions such as push or pull , give or take , etc. .",

These low-level features are input to an eventrecognition system that uses an inventory of hierarchical event structures and matches them against the data streaming in from low-level vision , similar to the systems described in ( SteelsBaillie , 2003 ) . In order to achieve the communicative grounding required for constructivist learning , agents go through scripts in which they play various language games , similar to the setups described in ( Steels , 2003 ) . These language games are deliberately quite similar to the kind of scenes and interactions used in a lot of child language research . A language game is a routinised interaction between two agents about a shared situation in the world that involves the exchange of symbols . Agents take turns playing the role of speaker and hearer and give each other feedback about the outcome of the game . In the game further used in this paper , one agent describes to another agent an event that happened in the most recently experienced scene . The game succeeds if the hearer agrees that the event being described occurred in the recent scene . 4 The Lexicon Visual processing and event recognition results in a world model in the form of a series of facts describing the scene . To play the description game , the speaker selects one event as the topic and then seeks a series of facts which discriminate this event and its objects against the other events and objects in the context .

This representation is more flexible and makes it possible to add new components ( like the manner of an event ) at any time . Syntactic structures mirror semantic structures . They also consist of units and the name of units are shared with semantic structures so that crossreference between them is straightforward . The form aspects of the sentence are represented in a declarative predicate calculus style , using the units as arguments .

And even if the hearer can figure it out , it is still desirable that the speaker should provide extra-information about equalities to optimise the hearers interpretation efforts . A major thesis of the present paper is that resolving equivalences between variables is the main motor for the introduction of syntax . To achieve it , the agents could , as a first approximation , use rules like the following one , to be applied after all lexical rules have been applied : This rule is formally equivalent to the lexical rules discussed earlier in the sense that it links parts of a semantic structure with parts of a syntactic structure . But now more than one unit is involved .

The above rule works but is completely specific to this case . It is an example of the ad hoc verb-island constructions reported in an early stage of child language development . Obviously it is much more desirable to have a more general rule , which can be achieved by introducing syntactic and semantic categories . A semantic category ( such as agent , perfective , countable , male ) is a categorisation of a conceptual relation , which is used to constrain the semantic side of grammatical rules . A syntactic category ( such as noun , verb , nominative ) is a categorisation of a word or a group of words , which can be used to constrain the syntactic side of grammatical rules . A rule using categories can be formed by taking rule [ 9 ] above and turning all predicates or content words into semantic or syntactic categories . The agent then needs to create sem-rules to categorise a predicate as belonging to a semantic category , as in : and syn-rules to categorise a word as belonging to a syntactic category , as in : These rules have arrows going only in one direction because they are only applied in one way .

Applying this rule as well as the synrules and sem-rules discussed earlier to the semantic structure in [ 5 ] yields : When this syntactic structure is rendered , it produces fall ball ba , or equivalently ball ba fall , because only the order between ball and ba is constrained . Obviously the introduction of additional syntactic features makes the learning of grammatical rules more difficult . Natural languages appear to have meta-level strategies for invention and abduction . For example , a language ( like Japanese ) tends to use particles for expressing the roles of objects in events and this usage is a strategy both for inventing the expression of a new relation and for guessing what the use of an unknown word in the sentence might be . Another language ( like Swahili ) uses morphological variations similar to Latin for the same purpose and thus has ended up with a rich set of affixes . In our experiments so far , we have implemented such strategies directly , so that invention and abduction is strongly constrained . We still need to work out a formalism for describing these strategies as metarules and research the associated learning mechanisms .

The predicate red belongs to semcat3 and the word red to syncat3 . Rendering the syntactic structure after application of this rule gives the sentence fall red ball ba . A hierarchical structure ( figure 3 ) emerges because ball participates in two rules . 7 Re-use Agents obviously should not invent new conventions from scratch every time they need one , but rather use as much as possible existing categorisations and hence existing rules . This simple economy principle quickly leads to the kind of syntagmatic and paradigmatic regularities that one finds in natural grammars . For example , if the speaker wants to express that a block is falling , no new semantic or syntactic categories or linking rules are needed but block can simply be declared to belong to semcat4 and block to syncat3 and rule [ 14 ] applies . Re-use should be driven by analogy . In one of the largest experiments we have carried out so far , agents had a way to compute the similarity between two event-structures by pairing the primitive operations making up an event . For example , a pick-up action is decomposed into : an object moving into the direction of another stationary object , the first object then touching the second object , and next the two objects moving together in ( roughly ) the opposite direction . A put-down action has similar subevents , except that their ordering is different .",

We present language phenomena observed in a corpus of dialogs with a simulated tutorial system for proving theorems as evidence for the need for deep syntactic and semantic analysis . We propose an approach to input understanding in this setting . Our goal is a uniform analysis of inputs of different degree of verbalization : ranging from symbolic alone to fully worded mathematical expressions . 1 Introduction Our goal is to develop a language understanding module for a flexible dialog system tutoring mathematical problem solving , in particular , theorem proving ( Benzmuller et al. , 2003a ) .1 As empirical findings in the area of intelligent tutoring show , flexible natural language dialog supports active learning ( Moore , 1993 ) . However , little is known about the use of natural language in dialog setting in formal domains , such as mathematics , due to the lack of empirical data . To fill this gap , we collected a corpus of dialogs with a simulated tutorial dialog system for teaching proofs in naive set theory . An investigation of the corpus reveals various phenomena that present challenges for such input understanding techniques as shallow syntactic analysis combined with keyword spotting , or statistical methods , e.g. , Latent Semantic Analysis , which are commonly employed in ( tutorial ) dialog systems . The prominent characteristics of the language in our corpus include : ( i ) tight interleaving of natural and symbolic language , ( ii ) varying degree of natural language verbalization of the formal mathematical content , and ( iii ) informal and/or imprecise reference to mathematical concepts and relations . These phenomena motivate the need for deep syntactic and semantic analysis in order to ensure correct mapping of the surface input to the underlying proof representation . An additional methodological desideratum is to provide a uniform treatment of the different degrees of verbalization of the mathematical content .",

Their shortcomings with respect to our setting become clear in Section 3 where we show examples of language phenomena from our dialogs . In Section 4 , we propose an analysis methodology that allows us to capture any mixture of natural and mathematical language in a uniform way . We show example analyses in Section 5 . In Section 6 , we conclude and point out future work issues . 2 Related work Language understanding in dialog systems , be it with text or speech interface , is commonly performed using shallow syntactic analysis combined with keyword spotting . Tutorial systems also successfully employ statistical methods which compare student responses to a model built from preconstructed gold-standard answers ( Graesser et al. , 2000 ) . This is impossible for our dialogs , due to the presence of symbolic mathematical expressions . Moreover , the shallow techniques also remain oblivious of such aspects of discourse meaning as causal relations , modality , negation , or scope of quantifiers which are of crucial importance in our setting .",

However , this conflicts with the preference for flexible dialog in active learning ( Moore , 1993 ) . With regard to interpreting mathematical texts , ( Zinn , 2003 ) and ( Baur , 1999 ) present DRT analyses of course-book proofs . However , the language in our dialogs is more informal : natural language and symbolic mathematical expressions are mixed more freely , there is a higher degree and more variety of verbalization , and mathematical objects are not properly introduced . Moreover , both above approaches rely on typesetting and additional information that identifies mathematical symbols , formulae , and proof steps , whereas our input does not contain any such information . Forcing the user to delimit formulae would reduce the flexibility of the system , make the interface harder to use , and might not guarantee a clean separation of the natural language and the non-linguistic content anyway . 3 Linguistic data In this section , we first briefly describe the corpus collection experiment and then present the common language phenomena found in the corpus . 3.1 Corpus collection 24 subjects with varying educational background and little to fair prior mathematical knowledge participated in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment ( Benzmuller et al. , 2003b ) .

Interleaved natural language and formulae Mathematical language , often semi-formal , is interleaved with natural language informally verbalizing proof steps . In particular , mathematical expressions ( or parts thereof ) may lie within the scope of quantifiers or negation expressed in natural language : For parsing , this means that the mathematical content has to be identified before it is interpreted within the utterance . Imprecise or informal naming Domain relations and concepts are described informally using imprecise and/or ambiguous expressions . A enthaelt B [ A contains B ] A muss in B sein [ A must be in B ] where contain and be in can express the domain relation of either subset or element ; where be outside of and be different are informal descriptions of the empty intersection of sets .

MMCCG is a lexicalist grammar formalism in which application of combinatory rules is controlled though context-sensitive specification of modes on slashes ( Baldridge and Kruijff , 2003 ) . The linguistic meaning , built in parallel with the syntax , is represented using Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics ( HLDS ) , a hybrid logic representation which allows a compositional , unification-based construction of HLDS terms with CCG ( Baldridge and Kruijff , 2002 ) .

For example , for the predicate contain , the lexicon contains the following facts : , ) ( SUBFORMULA , embedding ) [ a Patient of type FORMULA is a subformula embedded within a FORMULA in the Actor relation with respect to the head contain ] Translation rules that consult the ontology expand the meaning of the predicates to all their alternative domain-specific interpretations preserving argument structure . As it is in the capacity of neither sentence-level nor discourse-level analysis to evaluate the correctness of the alternative interpretations , this task is delegated to the Proof Manager ( PM ) . The task of the PM is to : ( A ) communicate directly with the theorem prover ; 9 ( B ) build and maintain a representation of the proof constructed by the student ; 10 ( C ) check type compatibility of proof-relevant entities introduced as new in discourse ; ( D ) check consistency and validity of each of the interpretations constructed by the analysis module , with the proof context ; ( E ) evaluate the proof-relevant part of the utterance with respect to completeness , accuracy , and relevance . 5 Example analysis In this section , we illustrate the mechanics of the approach on the following examples .",

        "input": "Supersense Tagging of Unknown Nouns using Semantic Similarity Abstract The limited coverage of lexical-semantic resources is a significant problem for NLP systems which can be alleviated by automatically classifying the unknown words . Supersense tagging assigns unknown nouns one of 26 broad semantic categories used by lexicographers to organise their manual insertion into WORDNET . Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples . We describe an unsupervised approach , based on vector-space similarity , which does not require annotated examples but significantly outperforms their tagger . We also demonstrate the use of an extremely large shallow-parsed corpus for calculating vector-space semantic similarity . 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) problems ranging from collocation extraction ( Pearce , 2001 ) and class-based smoothing ( Clark and Weir , 2002 ) , to text classification ( Baker and McCallum , 1998 ) and question answering ( Pasca and Harabagiu , 2001 ) . In particular , WORDNET ( Fellbaum , 1998 ) has significantly influenced research in NLP . Unfortunately , these resource are extremely timeconsuming and labour-intensive to manually develop and maintain , requiring considerable linguistic and domain expertise . Lexicographers can not possibly keep pace with language evolution : sense distinctions are continually made and merged , words are coined or become obsolete , and technical terms migrate into the vernacular . Technical domains , such as medicine , require separate treatment since common words often take on special meanings , and a significant proportion of their vocabulary does not overlap with everyday vocabulary . Burgun and Bodenreider ( 2001 ) compared an alignment of WORDNET with the UMLS medical resource and found only a very small degree of overlap .",

        "input": "Also , lexicalsemantic resources suffer from : bias towards concepts and senses from particular topics . Some specialist topics are better covered in WORDNET than others , e.g . dog has finer-grained distinctions than cat and worm although this does not reflect finer distinctions in reality ; limited coverage of infrequent words and senses . Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus . By WORDNET 2.0 , coverage has improved but the problem of keeping up with language evolution remains difficult . consistency when classifying similar words into categories . For instance , the WORDNET lexicographer file for ionosphere ( location ) is different to exosphere and stratosphere ( object ) , two other layers of the earths atmosphere . These problems demonstrate the need for automatic or semi-automatic methods for the creation and maintenance of lexical-semantic resources . Broad semantic classification is currently used by lexicographers to organise the manual insertion of words into WORDNET , and is an experimental precursor to automatically inserting words directly into the WORDNET hierarchy . Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger , which uses WORDNETs hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses . This paper describes an unsupervised approach to supersense tagging that does not require annotated sentences . Instead , we use vector-space similarity to retrieve a number of synonyms for each unknown common noun .",

This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1 . 2 Supersenses There are 26 broad semantic classes employed by lexicographers in the initial phase of inserting words into the WORDNET hierarchy , called lexicographerfzles ( lexfzles ) . For the noun hierarchy , there are 25 lex-files and a file containing the top level nodes in the hierarchy called Tops . Other syntactic classes are also organised using lex-files : 15 for verbs , 3 for adjectives and 1 for adverbs . Lex-files form a set of coarse-grained sense distinctions within WORDNET . For example , company appears in the following lex-files in WORDNET 2.0 : group , which covers company in the social , commercial and troupe fine-grained senses ; and state , which covers companionship . The names and descriptions of the noun lex-files are shown in Table 1 . Some lex-files map directly to the top level nodes in the hierarchy , called unique beginners , while others are grouped together as hyponyms of a unique beginner ( Fellbaum , 1998 , page 30 ) . For example , abstraction subsumes the lex-files attribute , quantity , relation , communication and time . Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses .",

( 2003 ) describe how the lex-files can be used as root nodes in a two level hierarchy with the WORDNET synsets appearing directly underneath . Other alternative sets of supersenses can be created by an arbitrary cut through the WORDNET hierarchy near the top , or by using topics from a thesaurus such as Rogets ( Yarowsky , 1992 ) . These topic distinctions are coarser-grained than WORDNET senses , which have been criticised for being too difficult to distinguish even for experts . Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses . They suggest that supersense tagging is similar to named entity recognition , which also has a very small set of categories with similar granularity ( e.g. location and person ) for labelling predominantly unseen terms . Supersense tagging can provide automated or semiautomated assistance to lexicographers adding words to the WORDNET hierarchy . Once this task is solved successfully , it may be possible to insert words directly into the fine-grained distinctions of the hierarchy itself .

The co-occurrence window was 500 words which was designed to approximate average document length . Caraballo and Charniak ( 1999 ) have explored determining noun specificity from raw text . They find that simple frequency counts are the most effective way of determining the parent-child ordering , achieving 83 % accuracy over types of vehicle , food and occupation . The other measure they found to be successful was the entropy of the conditional distribution of surrounding words given the noun . Specificity ordering is a necessary step for building a noun hierarchy . However , this approach clearly can not build a hierarchy alone . For instance , entity is less frequent than many concepts it subsumes . This suggests it will only be possible to add words to an existing abstract structure rather than create categories right up to the unique beginners .",

Schutzes ( 1992 ) WordSpace system was used to add topical links , such as between ball , racquet and game ( the tennis problem ) . Further , they also use the same vector-space techniques to label previously unseen words using the most common class assigned to the top 20 synonyms for that word . Widdows ( 2003 ) uses a similar technique to insert words into the WORDNET hierarchy . He first extracts synonyms for the unknown word using vector-space similarity measures based on Latent Semantic Analysis and then searches for a location in the hierarchy nearest to these synonyms . This same technique as is used in our approach to supersense tagging . Ciaramita and Johnson ( 2003 ) implement a supersense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier ( Crammer and Singer , 2001 ) , which uses the standard collocation , spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems . Their insight was to use the WORDNET glosses as annotated training data and massively increase the number of training instances using the noun hierarchy .

JACCARD and TTEST produced better quality synonyms than existing measures in the literature , so we use Curran and Moens configuration for our supersense tagging experiments . 6.1 Part of Speech Tagging and Chunking Our implementation of SEXTANT uses a maximum entropy POS tagger designed to be very efficient , tagging at around 100 000 words per second ( Curran and Clark , 2003 ) , trained on the entire Penn Treebank ( Marcus et al . , 1994 ) . The only similar performing tool is the Trigrams ` n Tags tagger ( Brants , 2000 ) which uses a much simpler statistical model . Our implementation uses a maximum entropy chunker which has similar feature types to Koeling ( 2000 ) and is also trained on chunks extracted from the entire Penn Treebank using the CoNLL 2000 script . Since the Penn Treebank separates PPs and conjunctions from NPs , they are concatenated to match Grefenstettes table-based results , i.e . the SEXTANT always prefers noun attachment . 6.2 Morphological Analysis Our implementation uses morpha , the Sussex morphological analyser ( Minnen et al . , 2001 ) , which is implemented using lex grammars for both affix splitting and generation . morpha has wide coverage nearly 100 % against the CELEX lexical database ( Minnen et al . , 2001 ) and is very efficient , analysing over 80 000 words per second . morpha often maintains sense distinctions between singular and plural nouns ; for instance : spectacles is not reduced to spectacle , but fails to do so in other cases : glasses is converted to glass .

Does every supersense of each extracted synonym get the whole weight of that synonym or is it distributed evenly between the supersenses like Resnik ( 1995 ) ? Another alternative is to only consider unambiguous synonyms with a single supersense in WORDNET . A disadvantage of this similarity approach is that it requires full synonym extraction , which compares the unknown word against a large number of words when , in fact , we want to calculate the similarity to a small number of supersenses .

One solution would be to take the intersection between vectors across words for each supersense ( i.e. to find the common contexts that these words appear in ) .

This contrasts with the generate-andtest architecture adopted by most previous empirically-based generation approaches , offering a more efficient , generic and holistic method of generator control . We illustrate the approach by describing a system in which stylistic variation ( in the sense of Biber ( 1988 ) ) can be effectively controlled during the generation of short medical information texts . 1 Introduction This paper1 is concerned with the problem of controlling the output of natural language generation ( NLG ) systems . In many application scenarios the generators task is underspecified , resulting in multiple possible solutions ( texts expressing the desired content ) , all equally good to the generator , but not equally appropriate for the application . Customising the generator directly to overcome this generally leads to ad-hoc , non-reusable solutions . A more modular approach is a generate-andtest architecture , in which all solutions are generated , and then ranked or otherwise selected according to their appropriateness in a separate post1 Paiva and Evans ( 2004 ) provides an overview of our framework and detailed comparison with previous approaches to stylistic control ( like Hovy ( 1988 ) , Green and DiMarco ( 1993 ) and Langkilde-Geary ( 2002 ) ) . This paper provides a more detailed account of the system and reports additional experimental results . process . Such architectures have been particularly prominent in the recent development of empirically-based approaches to NLG , where generator outputs can be selected according to application requirements acquired directly from human subjects ( e.g. Walker et al. ( 2002 ) ) or statistically from a corpus ( e.g. Langkilde-Geary ( 2002 ) ) .",

In the next section we describe a concrete instantiation of this architecture , in which variation is stylistic variation as characterised by a collection of shallow lexical and syntactic features . 3 An Implemented System In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this general approach , we implemented a system which attempts to control style of text generated as de fined by Biber ( 1988 ) in short text ( typically 2-3 sentences ) describing medicine dosage instructions . 3.1 Factor Analysis Biber characterised style in terms of very shallow linguistic features , such as presence of pronouns , auxiliaries , passives etc. . By using factor analysis techniques he was able to determine complex correlations between the occurrence and nonoccurrence of such features in text , which he used to characterise different styles of text .2 We adopted the same basic methodology , applied to a smaller more consistent corpus of just over 300 texts taken from proprietary patient information leaflets . Starting with around 70 surface linguistic features as variables , our factor analysis yielded two main factors ( each containing linguistic features grouped in positive and negative correlated subgroups ) which we used as our dimensions of variation . We interpreted these dimensions as follows ( this is a subjective process factor analysis does not itself provide any interpretation of factors ) : dimension 1 ranges from texts that try to involve the reader ( high positive score ) to text that try to be distant from the reader ( high negative score ) ; dimension 2 ranges from texts with more pronominal reference and a higher proportion of certain verbal forms ( high positive score ) to text that use full nominal reference ( high negative score ) .3 3.2 Generator Architecture The generator was constructed from a mixture of existing components and new implementation , using a fairly standard overall architecture as shown in figure 3 . Here , dotted lines show the control flow and the straight lines show data flow the choice point annotations are described below . The input constructor takes an input specification and , using a background database of medicine information , creates a network of concepts and re2 Some authors ( e.g. Lee ( 1999 ) ) have criticised Biber for making assumptions about the validity and generalisability of his approach to English language as a whole . Here , however , we use his methodology to characterise whatever variation exists without needing to make any broader claims .",

Although there are only three choice points in figure 3 , the control structure included two loops : an outer loop which ranges over the sequence of propnets , generating a sentence for each one , and an inner loop which ranges over subnetworks of a propnet as realisation rules are chosen . So the decision structure for even a small text may be quite complex . In the experiments reported here , the trace of the generation process is simply a record of the number of times each decision ( choice point , and what choice was made ) occurred . Paiva ( 2004 ) discusses more complex tracing models , where the context of each decision ( for example , what the preceding decision was ) is recorded and used in the correlation . However the best results were obtained using just the simple decision-counting model ( perhaps in part due to data sparseness for more complex models ) . 3.4 Correlating Decisions with Text Features By allowing the generator to freely generate all possible output from a single input , we recorded a set of < trace , text > pairs ranging across the full variation space . From these pairs we derived corresponding < decision-count , factor-score > pairs , to which we applied a very simple correlational technique , multivariate linear regression analysis , which is used to find an estimator function for a linear relationship ( i.e. , one that can be approximated by a straight line ) from the data available for several variables ( Weisberg , 1985 ) . In our case we want to predict the value for a score in a stylistic dimension ( SSi ) based on a configuration of generator decisions ( GDj ) as seen in equation 1 . We used three randomly sampled data sets of 1400 , 1400 and 5000 observations obtained from a potential base of about 1,400,000 different texts that could be produced by our generator from a single input .

Regression on Stylistic Dimension 1 For the regression model on the first stylistic dimension ( SS1 ) , the generator decisions that were used in the regression analysis7 are : imperative with one object sentences ( IMP _ VNP ) , V _ NP _ PP agentless passive sentences ( PAS _ VNPP ) , V _ NP bypassives ( BYPAS _ VN ) , and N _ PP clauses ( NPP ) and these are all decisions that happen in the realiser , i.e. , at the third choice point in the architecture . This resulted in the regression equation shown in equation 2 . 6 SSi represents a stylistic score and is the dependent variable or criterion in the regression analysis ; the GDjs represent generator decisions and are called the independent variables or predictors ; the xjs are weights , and c is the error . 7 The process of determining the regression takes care of eliminating the variables ( i.e. generator decisions ) that are not useful to estimate the stylistic dimensions . The coefficients for the regression on SS1 are unstandardised coefficients , i.e. the ones that are used when dealing with raw counts for the generator decisions . The coefficient of determination ( R2 ) , which measures the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable about its mean that is explained by the independent variables , had a reasonably high value ( .895 ) 9 and the analysis of variance obtained an F test of 1701.495 . One of the assumptions that this technique assumes is the linearity of the relation between the dependent and the independent variables ( i.e. , in our case , between the stylistic scores in a dimension and the generator decisions ) . The analysis of the residuals resulted in a graph that had some problems but that resembled a normal graph ( see ( Paiva , 2004 ) for more details ) . Regression on Stylistic Dimension 2 For the regression model on the second stylistic dimension ( SS2 ) the variables that we used were : the number of times a network was split ( SPLITNET ) , generation of a pronoun ( RE _ PRON ) , auxiliary verb ( VAUX ) , noun with determiner ( NOUN ) , transitive verb ( VNP ) , and agentless passive ( PAS _ VNP ) the first type of decision happens in the split network module ( our first choice point ) ; the second , in the referring expression module ( second choice point ) ; and the rest in the realiser ( third choice point ) . The main results for this model are as follows : the coefficient of determination ( R2 ) was .959 and the analysis of variance obtained an F test of 2298.519 .

In order to control the generator , the user specifies a target stylistic score for each dimension of the text to be generated . At each choice point during generation , all possible decisions are collected in a list and the regression equations are used to order them . The equations allow us to estimate the subsequent values of SS1 and SS2 for each of the possible decisions , and the decisions are ordered according to the distance of the resulting scores from the target scores the closer the score , the better the decision . Hence the search algorithm that we are using here is the best-first search , i.e . , the best local solution according to an evaluation function ( which in this case is the Euclidian distance from the target and the resulted value obtained by using the regression equation ) is tried first but all the other local solutions are kept in order so backtracking is possible . In this paper we report on tests of two internal aspects of the system11 . First we wish to know how good the generator is at hitting a user-specified target i.e. , how close are the scores given by the regression equations for the first text generated to the users input target scores . Second , we wish to know how good the regression equation scores are at modelling the original stylistic factors i.e. , we want to compare the regression scores of an output text with the factor analysis scores . We address these questions across the whole of the twodimensional stylistic space , by specifying a rectangular grid of scores spanning the whole space , and asking the generator to produce texts for each grid point from the same semantic input specification . In this case we divided the scoring space with an 8 by 10 grid pattern as shown in figure 6.12 Each point specifies the target scores for each text that should be generated ( the number next to each point is an identifier of each text ) .",

This can be done in two different ways . The first is to plot the resulting regression scores ( see figure 7 ) and visually check if it mirrors the grid-shape pattern of the target points ( figure 6 ) this can be done by inspecting the text identifiers13 . This can be a bit misleading because there will always be variation around the target point that was supposed to be achieved ( i.e. , there is a margin for error ) and this can blur the comparison unfavourably . A more formal comparison can be made by plotting the target points versus the regression results for each dimension separately and obtaining a correlation measure between these values . These correlations are shown in figure 8 for SS1 ( left ) and SS2 ( right ) . The degree of correlation ( R2 ) between the values of target and regression points is 0.9574 for SS1 and 0.942 for SS2 , which means that the search mechanism is working very satisfactorily on both dimensions .14 4.2 Comparing Target Points and Stylistic Scores In the second part of this experiment we wanted to know whether the regression equations were doing the job they were supposed to do by comparing the regression scores with stylistic scores obtained ( from the factor analysis ) for each of the generated texts . In figure 9 we plotted the texts in a graph in accordance with their stylistic scores ( once again , some texts occupy the same point so they do not appear ) . 14 All the correlational figures ( R2 ) presented for this experiment are significant at the 0.01 level ( twotailed ) . In the ideal situation , the generator would have produced texts with the perfect regression scores and they would be identical to the stylistic scores , so the graph in the figure 9 would be like a gridshape one as in figure 6 .

Figure 10 ( left-hand side ) shows the relation between the target points and the scores obtained from the original factor equation of SS1 . The value of R2 , which represents their correlation , is high ( 0.9458 ) , considering that this represents the possible accumulation of errors of two stages : from the target to the regression scores , and then from the regression to the actual factor scores . On the right of figure 10 we can see the plotting of the target points and their respective factor scores on SS2 . The correlation obtained is also reasonably high ( R2 = 0.9109 ) . 5 Discussion and Future Work These results demonstrate that it is possible to provide effective control of a generator correlating internal generator behaviour with characteristics of the resulting texts . It is important to note that these two sets of variables ( generator decision and surface features ) are in principle quite independent of each other . Although in some cases there are strong correlations ( for example , the generators use of a passive rule , correlates with the occurrence of passive participles in the text ) , in others the relationship is much less direct ( for example , the choice of how many subnetworks to split a network into , i.e. , SPLITNET , does not correspond to any feature in the factor analysis ) , and the way individual features combine into significant factors may be quite different . Another feature of our approach is that we do not assume some pre-defined notion of parameters of variation variation is characterised completely by a corpus ( in contrast to approaches which use a corpus to characterise a single style ) . The disadvantage of this is that variation is not grounded in some intuitive notion of style : the interpretation of the stylistic dimensions is subjective and tentative . However , as no comprehensive computationally realisable theory of style yet exists , we believe that this approach has considerable promise for practical , empirically-based stylistic control .",

        "input": "Named Entity Transliteration with Comparable Corpora Abstract In this paper we investigate ChineseEnglish name transliteration using comparable corpora , corpora where texts in the two languages deal in some of the same topics and therefore share references to named entities but are not translations of each other . We present two distinct methods for transliteration , one approach using phonetic transliteration , and the second using the temporal distribution of candidate pairs . Each of these approaches works quite well , but by combining the approaches one can achieve even better results . We then propose a novel score propagation method that utilizes the co-occurrence of transliteration pairs within document pairs . This propagation method achieves further improvement over the best results from the previous step . 1 Introduction As part of a more general project on multilingual named entity identification , we are interested in the problem of name transliteration across languages that use different scripts . One particular issue is the discovery of named entities in comparable texts in multiple languages , where by comparable we mean texts that are about the same topic , but are not in general translations of each other . For example , if one were to go through an English , Chinese and Arabic newspaper on the same day , it is likely that the more important international events in various topics such as politics , business , science and sports , would each be covered in each of the newspapers . Names of the same persons , locations and so forth which are often transliterated rather than translated would be found in comparable stories across the three papers .1 We wish to use this expectation to leverage transliteration , and thus the identification of named entities across languages . Our idea is that the occurrence of a cluster of names in , say , an English text , should be useful if we find a cluster of what looks like the same names in a Chinese or Arabic text . An example of what we are referring to can be found in Figure 1 .",

While some of the transliterations are standard thus Martin is conventionally transliterated asAi ' 1 : ma-erting many of them were clearly more novel , though all of them follow the standard Chinese conventions for transliterating foreign names . These sample documents illustrate an important point : if a document in language L1 has a set of names , and one finds a document in L2 containing a set of names that look as if they could be transliterations of the names in the L1 document , then this should boost ones confidence that the two sets of names are indeed transliterations of each other . We will demonstrate that this intuition is correct . 2 Previous Work In previous work on Chinese named-entity transliteration e.g. ( Meng et al. , 2001 ; Gao et al. , 2004 ) , the problem has been cast as the problem of producing , for a given Chinese name , an English equivalent such as one might need in a machine translation system .

The general idea of exploiting frequency correlations to acquire word translations from comparable corpora has been explored in several previous studies ( e.g. , ( Fung , 1995 ; Rapp , 1995 ; Tanaka and Iwasaki , 1996 ) ) . Recently , a method based on Pearson correlation was proposed to mine word pairs from comparable corpora ( Tao and Zhai , 2005 ) , an idea similar to the method used in ( Kay and Roscheisen , 1993 ) for sentence alignment . In our work , we adopt the method proposed in ( Tao and Zhai , 2005 ) and apply it to the problem of transliteration . We also study several variations of the similarity measures . Mining transliterations from multilingual web pages was studied in ( Zhang and Vines , 2004 ) ; Our work differs from this work in that we use comparable corpora ( in particular , news data ) and leverage the time correlation information naturally available in comparable corpora . 3 Chinese Transliteration with Comparable Corpora We assume that we have comparable corpora , consisting of newspaper articles in English and Chinese from the same day , or almost the same day .

To perform the transliteration task , we propose the following general three-step approach : The intuition behind the third step is the following .

As we will show later , such a propagation strategy can generally further improve the transliteration accuracy ; in particular , it can further improve the already high performance from combining the two scoring methods . 3.1 Candidate Selection The English named entity candidate selection process was already described above . Candidate Chinese transliterations are generated by consulting a list of characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names . As discussed elsewhere ( Sproat et al. , 1996 ) , a subset of a few hundred characters ( out of several thousand ) tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating foreign names into Chinese . We use a list of 495 such characters , derived from various online dictionaries . A sequence of three or more characters from the list is taken as a possible name . If the character occurs , which is frequently used to represent the space between parts of an English name , then at least one character to the left and right of this character will be collected , even if the character in question is not in the list of foreign characters . Armed with the English and Chinese candidate lists , we then consider the pairing of every English candidate with every Chinese candidate . Obviously it would be impractical to do this for all of the candidates generated for , say , an entire year : we consider as plausible pairings those candidates that occur within a day of each other in the two corpora . 3.2 Candidate scoring based on pronunciation We adopt a source-channel model for scoring English-Chinese transliteration pairs . In general , we seek to estimate P ( elc ) , where e is a word in Roman script , and c is a word in Chinese script .",

        "input": "Since Chinese transliteration is mostly based on pronunciation , we estimate P ( e | c ) , where e is the pronunciation of e and c is the pronunciation of c. Again following standard practice , we decompose the estimate of P ( e | c ) as P ( e | c ) _ Ili P ( ei | ci ) . Here , ei is the ith subsequence of the English phone string , and ci is the ith subsequence of the Chinese phone string . Since Chinese transliteration attempts to match the syllablesized characters to equivalent sounding spans of the English language , we fix the ci to be syllables , and let the ei range over all possible subsequences of the English phone string . For training data we have a small list of 721 names in Roman script and their Chinese equivalent . Pronunciations for English words are obtained using the Festival text-tospeech system ( Taylor et al . , 1998 ) ; for Chinese , we use the standard pinyin transliteration of the characters . English-Chinese pairs in our training dictionary were aligned using the alignment algorithm from ( Kruskal , 1999 ) , and a hand-derived set of 21 rules-of-thumb : for example , we have rules that encode the fact that Chinese / l / can correspond to English / r / , / n / or / er / ; and that Chinese / w / may be used to represent / v / . Given that there are over 400 syllables in Mandarin ( not counting tone ) and each of these syllables can match a large number of potential English phone spans , this is clearly not enough training data to cover all the parameters , and so we use Good-Turing estimation to estimate probabilities for unseen correspondences . Since we would like to filter implausible transliteration pairs we are less lenient than standard estimation techniques in that we are willing to assign zero probability to some correspondences . Thus we set a hard rule that for an English phone span to correspond to a Chinese syllable , the initial phone of the English span must have been seen in the training data as corresponding to the initial of the Chinese syllable some minimum number of times .",

This phonetic correspondence model can then be used to score putative transliteration pairs . 3.3 Candidate Scoring based on Frequency Correlation Names of the same entity that occur in different languages often have correlated frequency patterns due to common triggers such as a major event . Thus if we have comparable news articles over a sufficiently long time period , it is possible to exploit such correlations to learn the associations of names in different languages . The idea of exploiting frequency correlation has been well studied . ( See the previous work section . ) We adopt the method proposed in ( Tao and Zhai , 2005 ) , which works as follows : We pool all documents in a single day to form a large pseudo-document . Then , for each transliteration candidate ( both Chinese and English ) , we compute its frequency in each of those pseudo-documents and obtain a raw frequency vector . We further normalize the raw frequency vector so that it becomes a frequency distribution over all the time points ( days ) . In order to compute the similarity between two distribution vectors , The Pearson correlation coefficient was used in ( Tao and Zhai , 2005 ) ; here we also considered two other commonly used measures cosine ( Salton and McGill , 1983 ) , and Jensen-Shannon divergence ( Lin , 1991 ) , though our results show that Pearson correlation coefficient performs better than these two other methods . 3.4 Score Propagation In both scoring methods described above , scoring of each candidate transliteration pair is independent of the other . As we have noted , document pairs that contain lots of plausible transliteration pairs should be viewed as more plausible document pairs ; at the same time , in such a situation we should also trust the putative transliteration pairs more . Thus these document pairs and transliteration pairs mutually reinforce each other , and this can be exploited to further optimize our transliteration scores by allowing transliteration pairs to propagate their scores to each other according to their co-occurrence strengths .",

These pairs along with their co-occurrence relation computed based on our comparable corpora can be formally represented by a graph as shown in Figure 2 . In such a graph , a node represents ( ei , ci , wi ) . An edge between ( ei , ci , wi ) and ( ej , cj , wj ) is constructed iff ( ei , ci ) and ( ej , cj ) co-occur in a certain document pair ( Et , Ct ) , i.e. there exists a document pair ( Et , Ct ) , such that ei , ej Et and ci , cj Ct. . Given a node ( ei , ci , wi ) , we refer to all its directly-connected nodes as its neighbors .

Indeed , intuitively the best candidate is the one that has a good pronunciation alignment as well as a correlated frequency distribution with the English name .

The first strategy is to use the phonetic model to filter out ( clearly impossible ) candidates and then use the frequency correlation method to rank the candidates .

        "input": "Guiding a Constraint Dependency Parser with Supertags Abstract We investigate the utility of supertag information for guiding an existing dependency parser of German . Using weighted constraints to integrate the additionally available information , the decision process of the parser is influenced by changing its preferences , without excluding alternative structural interpretations from being considered . The paper reports on a series of experiments using varying models of supertags that significantly increase the parsing accuracy . In addition , an upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved with perfect supertags is estimated . 1 Introduction Supertagging is based on the combination of two powerful and influential ideas of natural language processing : On the one hand , parsing is ( at least partially ) reduced to a decision on the optimal sequence of categories , a problem for which efficient and easily trainable procedures exist . On the other hand , supertagging exploits complex categories , i.e. tree fragments which much better reflect the mutual compatibility between neighbouring lexical items than say part-of-speech tags . Bangalore and Joshi ( 1999 ) derived the notion of supertag within the framework of Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars ( LTAG ) ( Schabes and Joshi , 1991 ) . They considered supertagging a process of almost parsing , since all that needs to be done after having a sufficiently reliable sequence of supertags available is to decide on their combination into a spanning tree for the complete sentence . Thus the approach lends itself easily to preprocessing sentences or filtering parsing results with the goal of guiding the parser or reducing its output ambiguity . Nasr and Rambow ( 2004 ) estimated that perfect supertag information already provides for a parsing accuracy of 98 % if a correct supertag assignment were available . Unfortunately , perfectly reliable supertag information can not be expected ; usually this uncertainty is compensated by running the tagger in multi-tagging mode , expecting that the reliability can be increased by not forcing the tagger to take unreliable decisions but instead offering a set of alternatives from which a subsequent processing component can choose .",

        "input": "A grammar formalism which seems particularly well suited to decompose structural descriptions into lexicalized tree fragments is dependency grammar . It allows us to define supertags on different levels of granularity ( White , 2000 ; Wang and Harper , 2002 ) , thus facilitating a fine grained analysis of how the different aspects of supertag information influence the parsing behaviour . In the following we will use this characteristic to study in more detail the utility of different kinds of supertag information for guiding the parsing process . Usually supertags are combined with a parser in a filtering mode , i.e. parsing hypotheses which are not compatible with the supertag predictions are simply discarded . Drawing on the ability of Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar ( WCDG ) ( Schroder et al . , 2000 ) to deal with defeasible constraints , here we try another option for making available supertag information : Using a score to estimate the general reliability of unique supertag decisions , the information can be combined with evidence derived from other constraints of the grammar in a soft manner . It makes possible to rank parsing hypotheses according to their plausibility and allows the parser to even override potentially wrong supertag decisions . Starting from a range of possible supertag models , Section 2 explores the reliability with which dependency-based supertags can be determined on es mag sein , da die Franzosen kein schlssiges Konzept fr eine echte Partnerschaft besitzen . different levels of granularity . Then , Section 3 describes how supertags are integrated into the existing parser for German . The complex nature of supertags as we define them makes it possible to separate the different structural predictions made by a single supertag into components and study their contributions independently ( c.f.

A simple definition with very small number of supertags will not be able to capture the full variety of syntactic contexts that actually occur , while an overly expressive definition may lead to a tag set that is so large that it can not be accurately learnt from the training data . The local context of a word to be encoded in a supertag could include its edge label , the attachment direction , the occurrence of obligatory1 or of all dependents , whether each predicted dependent occurs to the right or to the left of the word , and the relative order among different dependents . The simplest useful task that could be asked of a supertagger would be to predict the dependency relation that each word enters . In terms of the WCDG formalism , this means associating each word at least with one of the syntactic labels that decorate dependency edges , such as SUBJ or DET ; in other words , the supertag set would be identical to the label set . The example sentence Following ( Wang and Harper , 2002 ) , we further classify dependencies into Left ( L ) , Right ( R ) , and No attachments ( N ) , depending on whether a word is attached to its left or right , or not at all . We combine the label with the attachment direction to obtain composite supertags . The sequence of supertags describing the example sentence would then begin with EXPL/R S/N AUX/L ... Although this kind of supertag describes the role of each word in a sentence , it still does not specify the entire local context ; for instance , it associates the information that a word functions as a subject only with the subject and not with the verb that takes the subject . In other words , it does not predict the relations under a given word .",

For instance , the word mag in the example sentence is modified by an expletive ( EXPL ) on its left side and by an auxiliary ( AUX ) and a subject clause ( SUBJC ) dependency on its right side . To capture this extended local context , these labels must be encoded into the supertag . We add the local context of a word to the end of its supertag , separated with the delimiter + . This yields the expression S/N + AUX , EXPL , SUBJC . If we also want to express that the EXPL precedes the word but the AUX follows it , we can instead add two new fields to the left and to the right of the supertag , which leads to the new supertag EXPL+S / N+AUX , SUBJC .

Note that the notation + EXPL/R + explicitly represents the fact that the word labelled EXPL has no dependents of its own , while the simpler EXPL/R made no assertion of this kind .

Also , in tagging mode it can fail to process sentences with many unknown words in close succession . In such cases , we simply ran it on shorter fragments of the sentence until no error occurred . Fewer than 0.5 % of all sentences were affected by this problem even with the largest tag set . A more serious problem arises when using a stochastic process to assign tags that partially predict structure : the tags emitted by the model may contradict each other . Consider , for instance , the following supertagger output for the previous example sentence : The supertagger correctly predicts that the first three labels are EXPL , S , and AUX . It also predicts that the word sein has a preceding PRED complement , but this is impossible if the two preceding words are labelled EXPL and S . Such contradictory information is not fatal in a robust system , but it is likely to cause unnecessary work for the parser when some rules demand the impossible . We therefore decided simply to ignore context predictions when they contradict the basic label predictions made for the same sentence ; in other words , we pretend that the prediction for the third word was just + AUX/L + rather than PRED+AUX / L + .

        "input": "The last columns of Table 2 give the number of different supertags in the training set and the performance of the retrained TnT on the test set in single-tagging mode . Although the number of oc curring tags rises and the prediction accuracy falls with the supertag complexity , the correlation is not absolute : It seems markedly easier to predict supertags with complements but no direction information ( C ) than supertags with direction information but no complements ( B ) , although the tag set is larger by an order of magnitude . In fact , the prediction of attachment direction seems much more difficult than that of undirected supertags in every case , due to the semi-free word order of German . The greater tag set size when predicting complements of each words is at least partly offset by the contextual information available to the n-gram model , since it is much more likely that a word will have , e.g . , a SUBJ complement when an adjacent SUBJ supertag is present . For the simplest model A , all 35 possible supertags actually occur , while in the most complicated model J , only 12,947 different supertags are observed in the training data ( out of a theoretically possible 1024 for a set of 35 edge labels ) . Note that this is still considerably larger than most other reported supertag sets . The prediction quality falls to rather low values with the more complicated models ; however , our goal in this paper is not to optimize the supertagger , but to estimate the effect that an imperfect one has on an existing parser . Altogether most results fall into a range of 7080 % of accuracy ; as we will see later , this is in fact enough to provide a benefit to automatic parsing . Although supertag accuracy is usually determined by simply counting matching and nonmatching predictions , a more accurate measure should take into account how many of the individual predictions that are combined into a supertag are correct or wrong . For instance , a word that is attached to its left as a subject , is preceded by a preposition and an attributive adjective , and followed by an apposition would bear the supertag PP , ATTR+SUBJ / L+APP .",

Although this supertag is technically wrong , it is in fact much more right than wrong : of the four predictions of label , direction , preceding and following dependents , three are correct and only one is wrong . We therefore define the component accuracy for a given model as the ratio of correct predictions among the possible ones , which results in a value of 0.75 rather than 0 for the example prediction . The component accuracy of the supertag model J e . g . is in fact 84.5 % rather than 67.6 % . We would expect the component accuracy to match the effect on parsing more closely than the supertag accuracy . 3 Using supertag information in WCDG Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar ( WCDG ) is a formalism in which declarative constraints can be formulated that describe well-formed dependency trees in a particular natural language . A grammar composed of such constraints can be used for parsing by feeding it to a constraint-solving component that searches for structures that satisfy the constraints . Each constraint carries a numeric score or penalty between 0 and 1 that indicates its importance . The penalties of all instances of constraint violations are multiplied to yield a score for an entire analysis ; hence , an analysis that satisfies all rules of the WCDG bears the score 1 , while lower values indicate small or large aberrations from the language norm . A constraint penalty of 0 , then , corresponds to a hard constraint , since every analysis that violates such a constraint will always bear the worst possible score of 0 . This means that of two constraints , the one with the lower penalty is more important to the grammar .",

Of two possible analyses of an utterance , the one that satisfies more ( or more important ) constraints is always preferred . All knowledge about grammatical rules is encoded in the constraints that ( together with the lexicon ) constitute the grammar . Adding a constraint which is sensitive to supertag predictions will therefore change the objective function of the optimization problem , hopefully leading to a higher share of correct attachments . Details about the WDCG parser can be found in ( Foth and Menzel , 2006 ) . A grammar of German is available ( Foth et al . , 2004 ) that achieves a good accuracy on written German input . Despite its good results , it seems probable that the information provided by a supertag prediction component could improve the accuracy further . First , because the optimization problem that WCDG defines is infeasible to solve exactly , the parser must usually use incomplete , heuristic algorithms to try to compute the optimal analysis . This means that it sometimes fails to find the correct analysis even if the language model accurately defines it , because of search errors during heuristic optimization . A component that makes specific predictions about local structure could guide the process so that the correct alternative is tried first in more cases , and help prevent such search errors .",

To make the information from the supertag sequence available to the parser , we treat the complex supertags as a set of predictions and write constraints to prefer those analyses that satisfy them . The predictions of label and direction made by models A and B are mapped onto two constraints which demand that each word in the analysis should exhibit the predicted label and direction . The more complicated supertag models constrain the local context of each word further . Effectively , they predict that the specified dependents of a word occur , and that no other dependents occur . The former prediction equates to an existence condition , so constraints are added which demand the presence of the predicted relation types under that word ( one for left dependents and one for right dependents ) . The latter prediction disallows all other dependents ; it is implemented by two constraints that test the edge label of each word-to-word attachment against the set of predicted dependents of the regent ( again , separately for left and right dependents ) . Altogether six new constraints are added to the grammar which refer to the output of the supertagger on the current sentence .

        "input": "Alternatives could be integrated by computing the logical disjunctions of the predictions made by each supertag , and then adapting the new constraints accordingly . 4 Experiments We tested the effect of supertag predictions on a full parser by adding the new constraints to the WCDG of German described in ( Foth et al . , 2004 ) and re-parsing the same 1,000 sentences from the NEGRA corpus . The quality of a dependency parser such as this can be measured as the ratio of correctly attached words to all words ( structural accuracy ) or the ratio of the correctly attached and correctly labelled words to all words ( labelled accuracy ) . Note that because the parser always finds exactly one analysis with exactly one subordination per word , there is no distinction between recall and precision . The structural accuracy without any supertags is 89.6 % . To determine the best trade-off between complexity and prediction quality , we tested all 10 supertag models against the baseline case of no supertags at all . The results are given in Table 3 . Two observations can be made about the effect of the supertag model on parsing . Firstly , all types of supertag prediction , even the very basic model A which predicts only edge labels , improve the overall accuracy of parsing , although the baseline is already quite high . Second , the richer models of supertags appear to be more suitable for guiding the parser than the simpler ones , even though their own accuracy is markedly lower ; almost one third of the supertag predictions according to the most compli cated definition J are wrong , but nevertheless their inclusion reduces the remaining error rate of the parser by over 20 % .

Obviously , this trend can not continue indefinitely ; a supertag definition that predicted even larger parts of the dependency tree would certainly lead to much lower accuracy by even the most lenient measure , and a prediction that is mostly wrong must ultimately degrade parsing performance . Since the most complex model J shows no parsing improvement over its successor I , this point might already have been reached . The use of supertags in WCDG is comparable to previous work which integrated POS tagging and chunk parsing . ( Foth and Hagenstrom , 2002 ; Daum et al. , 2003 ) showed that the correct balance between the new knowledge and the existing grammar is crucial for successful integration . This is achieved by means of an additional parameter , modeling how trustworthy supertag predictions are considered . Its effect is shown in Table 4 . As expected , making supertag constraints hard ( with a value of 0.0 ) over-constrains most parsing problems , so that hardly any analyses can be computed . Other values near 0 avoid this problem but still lead to much worse overall performance , as wrong or even impossible predictions too often overrule the normal syntax constraints . The previously used value of 0.9 actually yields the best results with this particular grammar . The fact that a statistical model can improve parsing performance when superimposed on a sophisticated hand-written grammar is of particular interest because the statistical model we used is so simple , and in fact not particularly accurate ; it certainly does not represent the state of the art in supertagging .",

To obtain this upper limit of the utility of supertags we repeated the process of translating each supertag into additional WCDG constraints , but this time using the test set itself rather than TnTs predictions . Table 5 again gives the unlabelled and labelled parsing accuracy for all 10 different supertag models with the integration strengths of 0 and 0.9 .

In fact , knowing the correct supertag would solve the parsing problem almost completely with the more complex models . This confirms earlier findings for English ( Nasr and Rambow , 2004 ) . Since perfect supertaggers are not available , we have to make do with the imperfect ones that do exist . One method of avoiding some errors introduced by supertagging would be to reject supertag predictions that tend to be wrong .

However , the effect is not very noticeable , so that it would be almost certainly more useful to improve the supertagger itself rather than secondguess its output . 5 Related work Supertagging was originally suggested as a method to reduce lexical ambiguity , and thereby the amount of disambiguation work done by the parser . Sakar et al . ( 2000 ) report that this increases the speed of their LTAG parser by a factor of 26 ( from 548k to 21k seconds ) but at the price of only being able to parse 59 % of the sentences in their test data ( of 2250 sentences ) , because too often the correct supertag is missing from the output of the supertagger . Chen et al . ( 2002 ) investigate different supertagging methods as pre-processors to a Tree-Adjoining Grammar parser , and they claim a 1 - best supertagging accuracy of 81.47 % , and a 4best accuracy of 91.41 % . With the latter they reach the highest parser coverage , about three quarters of the 1700 sentences in their test data . Clark and Curran ( 2004a ; 2004b ) describe a combination of supertagger and parser for parsing Combinatory Categorial Grammar , where the tagger is used to filter the parses produced by the grammar , before the computation of the model parameters . The parser uses an incremental method : the supertagger first assigns a small number of categories to each word , and the parser requests more alternatives only if the analysis fails . They report 91.4 % precision and 91.0 % recall of unlabelled dependencies and a speed of 1.6 minutes to parse 2401 sentences , and claim a parser speedup of a factor of 77 thanks to supertagging . The supertagging approach that is closest to ours in terms of linguistic representations is probably ( Wang and Harper , 2002 ; Wang and Harper , 2004 ) whose Super Abstract Role Values are very similar to our model F supertags ( Table 2 ) .",

An important point is that for some other systems , like ( Sarkar et al. , 2000 ) and ( Chen et al. , 2002 ) , parsing is not actually feasible without the supertagging speedup . 6 Conclusions and future work We have shown that a statistical supertagging component can significantly improve the parsing accuracy of a general-purpose dependency parser for German . The error rate among syntactic attachments can be reduced by 24 % over an already competitive baseline . After all , the integration of the supertagging results helped to reach a quality level which compares favourably with the state-of-the-art in probabilistic dependency parsing for German as defined with 87.34 % / 90.38 % labelled / unlabelled attachment accuracy on this years shared CoNLL task by ( McDonald et al . , 2005 ) ( see ( Foth and Menzel , 2006 ) for a more detailed comparison ) . Although the statistical model used in our system is rather simple-minded , it clearly captures at least some distributional char acteristics of German text that the hand-written rules do not . A crucial factor for success is the defeasible integration of the supertagging predictions via soft constraints . Rather than pursuing a strict filtering approach where supertagging errors are partially compensated by an n-best selection , we commit to only one supertag per word , but reduce its influence . Treating supertag predictions as weak preferences yields the best results . By measuring the accuracy of the different types of predictions made by complex supertags , different weights could also be assigned to the six new constraints .",

        "input": "Domain Adaptation with Active Learning for Word Sense Disambiguation Abstract When a word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) system is trained on one domain but applied to a different domain , a drop in accuracy is frequently observed . This highlights the importance of domain adaptation for word sense disambiguation . In this paper , we first show that an active learning approach can be successfully used to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems . Then , by using the predominant sense predicted by expectation-maximization ( EM ) and adopting a count-merging technique , we improve the effectiveness of the original adaptation process achieved by the basic active learning approach . 1 Introduction In natural language , a word often assumes different meanings , and the task of determining the correct meaning , or sense , of a word in different contexts is known as word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) . To date , the best performing systems in WSD use a corpus-based , supervised learning approach . With this approach , one would need to collect a text corpus , in which each ambiguous word occurrence is first tagged with its correct sense to serve as training data . The reliance of supervised WSD systems on annotated corpus raises the important issue of domain dependence . To investigate this , Escudero et al . ( 2000 ) and Martinez and Agirre ( 2000 ) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus , which contains sentences from two different corpora , namely Brown Corpus ( BC ) and Wall Street Journal ( WSJ ) . They found that training a WSD system on one part ( BC or WSJ ) of the DSO corpus , and applying it to the other , can result in an accuracy drop of more than 10 % , highlighting the need to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems to new domains . Escudero et al . ( 2000 ) pointed out that one of the reasons for the drop in accuracy is the difference in sense priors ( i.e . , the proportions of the different senses of a word ) between BC and WSJ .",

In this paper , we explore domain adaptation of WSD systems , by adding training examples from the new domain as additional training data to a WSD system . To reduce the effort required to adapt a WSD system to a new domain , we employ an active learning strategy ( Lewis and Gale , 1994 ) to select examples to annotate from the new domain of interest . To our knowledge , our work is the first to use active learning for domain adaptation for WSD . A similar work is the recent research by Chen et al . ( 2006 ) , where active learning was used successfully to reduce the annotation effort for WSD of 5 English verbs using coarse-grained evaluation . In that work , the authors only used active learning to reduce the annotation effort and did not deal with the porting of a WSD system to a new domain . Domain adaptation is necessary when the training and target domains are different . In this paper , we perform domain adaptation for WSD of a set of its BC and WSJ parts to investigate the domain denouns using fine-grained evaluation .

SEMCOR is a subset of BC which is sense-annotated . Since BC is a balanced corpus , and since performing adaptation from a general corpus to a more specific corpus is a natural scenario , we focus on adapting a WSD system trained on BC to WSJ in this paper . Henceforth , out-of-domain data will refer to BC examples , and in-domain data will refer to WSJ examples . In the next section , we discuss the choice of corpus and nouns used in our experiments . Since the focus of the WSJ corpus is on business and financial news , we can make use of WordNet Domains to select the set of nouns having at least one synset labeled with a business or finance related domain label . This is similar to the approach taken in ( Koeling et al . , 2005 ) where they focus on determining the predominant sense of words in corpora drawn from finance versus sports domains .1 Hence , we select the subset of DSO nouns that have at least one synset labeled with any of these domain labels : commerce , enterprise , money , finance , banking , and economy . This gives a set of 21 nouns : book , business , center , community , condition , field , figure , house , interest , land , line , money , need , number , order , part , power , society , term , use , value .2 For each noun , all the BC examples are used as out-of-domain training data . One-third of the WSJ examples for each noun are set aside as evaluation data , and the rest of the WSJ examples are designated as in-domain adaptation data . 1Note however that the coverage of the WordNet Domains resource is not comprehensive , as about 31 % of the synsets are simply labeled with factotum , indicating that the synset does not belong to a specific domain . 225 nouns have at least one synset labeled with the listed domain labels .",

To obtain a clearer picture of the adaptation process , we discard these 4 nouns , leaving a set of data , and the rest of the WSJ examples are designated as in-domain adaptation data . The row 21 nouns in Table 1 shows some information about these 21 nouns . For instance , these nouns have an average of 6.7 senses in BC and 6.8 senses in WSJ . This is slightly higher than the 5.8 senses per verb in ( Chen et al. , 2006 ) , where the experiments were conducted using coarse-grained evaluation . Assuming we have access to an oracle which determines the predominant sense , or most frequent sense ( MFS ) , of each noun in our WSJ test data perfectly , and we assign this most frequent sense to each noun in the test data , we will have achieved an accuracy of 61.1 % as shown in the column MFS accuracy of Table 1 . Finally , we note that we have an average of 310 BC training examples and 406 WSJ adaptation examples per noun . 3 Active Learning For our experiments , we use naive Bayes as the learning algorithm .

Hence , the annotation of an example needed during each adaptation iteration is simulated by performing a lookup without any manual annotation . 4 Count-merging We also employ a technique known as countmerging in our domain adaptation study . Countmerging assigns different weights to different examples to better reflect their relative importance . Roark and Bacchiani ( 2003 ) showed that weighted count-merging is a special case of maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimation , and successfully used it for probabilistic context-free grammar domain adaptation ( Roark and Bacchiani , 2003 ) and language model adaptation ( Bacchiani and Roark , 2003 ) .",

Further , let us define bpL ( i ) as the a priori probability of class i in DL . This can be estimated by the class frequency of i in DL .

Classification accuracies averaged over 3 random trials on the WSJ test examples at each iteration are calculated .

We can similarly choose BC examples such that the sense priors in the BC training data adhere to the sense priors in the WSJ evaluation data . To gauge the effectiveness of this approach , we first assume that we know the true sense priors of each noun in the WSJ evaluation data .

( 2004 ) and Koeling et al. ( 2005 ) pointed out that a change of predominant sense is often indicative of a change in domain . For example , the predominant sense of the noun interest in the BC part of the DSO corpus has the meaning a sense of concern with and curiosity about someone or something . In the WSJ part of the DSO corpus , the noun interest has a different predominant sense with the meaning a fixed charge for borrowing money , which is reflective of the business and finance focus of the WSJ corpus .

This is higher than an average of 83 BC examples for these 9 nouns if BC examples are selected to follow the sense priors of WSJ evaluation data as described in the last subsection 6.2 . For these 9 nouns , the average KL-divergence between the sense priors of the original BC data and WSJ evaluation data is 0.81 .

This paper describes an improved confusion network based method to combine outputs from multiple MT systems . In this approach , arbitrary features may be added log-linearly into the objective function , thus allowing language model expansion and re-scoring . Also , a novel method to automatically select the hypothesis which other hypotheses are aligned against is proposed . A generic weight tuning algorithm may be used to optimize various automatic evaluation metrics including TER , BLEU and METEOR . The experiments using the 2005 Arabic to English and Chinese to English NIST MT evaluation tasks show significant improvements in BLEU scores compared to earlier confusion network decoding based methods . 1 Introduction System combination has been shown to improve classification performance in various tasks .

The classifiers may be based on the same basic modeling techniques but differ by , for example , alternative feature representations . Combination of speech recognition outputs is an example of this approach ( Fiscus , 1997 ) . In speech recognition , confusion network decoding ( Mangu et al. , 2000 ) has become widely used in system combination . Unlike speech recognition , current statistical machine translation ( MT ) systems are based on various different paradigms ; for example phrasal , hierarchical and syntax-based systems . The idea of combining outputs from different MT systems to produce consensus translations in the hope of generating better translations has been around for a while ( Frederking and Nirenburg , 1994 ) . Recently , confusion network decoding for MT system combination has been proposed ( Bangalore et al. , 2001 ) . To generate confusion networks , hypotheses have to be aligned against each other . In ( Bangalore et al . , 2001 ) , Levenshtein alignment was used to generate the network . As opposed to speech recognition , the word order between two correct MT outputs may be different and the Levenshtein alignment may not be able to align shifted words in the hypotheses .",

As the skeleton determines the word order , the quality of the combination output also depends on which hypothesis is chosen as the skeleton . Since the modified Levenshtein alignment produces TER scores between the skeleton and the other hypotheses , a natural choice for selecting the skeleton is the minimum average TER score . The hypothesis resulting in the lowest average TER score when aligned against all other hypotheses is chosen as the skeleton as follows where is the number of systems . This is equivalent to minimum Bayes risk decoding with uniform posterior probabilities ( Sim et al. , 2007 ) . Other evaluation metrics may also be used as the MBR loss function .

The word confidences were increased by if the word aligns between nodes and in the network . If no word aligns between nodes and , the NULL word confidence at that position was increased by . The last term controls the number of NULL words generated in the output and may be viewed as an insertion penalty . Each arc in the confusion network carries the word label and scores . The decoder outputs the hypothesis with the highest given the current set of weights . 3.1 Discussion There are several problems with the previous confusion network decoding approaches . First , the decoding can generate ungrammatical hypotheses due to alignment errors and phrases broken by the where is the language model weight , is the LM log-probability and is the number of words in the hypothesis .",

        "input": "Efficient Multi-pass Decoding for Synchronous Context Free Grammars Abstract We take a multi-pass approach to machine translation decoding when using synchronous context-free grammars as the translation model and n-gram language models : the first pass uses a bigram language model , and the resulting parse forest is used in the second pass to guide search with a trigram language model . The trigram pass closes most of the performance gap between a bigram decoder and a much slower trigram decoder , but takes time that is insignificant in comparison to the bigram pass . An additional fast decoding pass maximizing the expected count of correct translation hypotheses increases the BLEU score significantly . 1 Introduction Statistical machine translation systems based on synchronous grammars have recently shown great promise , but one stumbling block to their widespread adoption is that the decoding , or search , problem during translation is more computationally demanding than in phrase-based systems . This complexity arises from the interaction of the tree-based translation model with an n-gram language model . Use of longer n-grams improves translation results , but exacerbates this interaction . In this paper , we present three techniques for attacking this problem in order to obtain fast , high-quality decoders . First , we present a two-pass decoding algorithm , in which the first pass explores states resulting from an integrated bigram language model , and the second pass expands these states into trigram-based states . The general bigram-to-trigram technique is common in speech recognition ( Murveit et al . , 1993 ) , where lattices from a bigram-based decoder are re-scored with a trigram language model . We examine the question of whether , given the reordering inherent in the machine translation problem , lower order n-grams will provide as valuable a search heuristic as they do for speech recognition . Second , we explore heuristics for agenda-based search , and present a heuristic for our second pass that combines precomputed language model information with information derived from the first pass .",

Third , given the significant speedup in the agenda-based trigram decoding pass , we can rescore the trigram forest to maximize the expected count of correct synchronous constituents of the model , using the product of inside and outside probabilities . Maximizing the expected count of synchronous constituents approximately maximizes BLEU . We find a significant increase in BLEU in the experiments , with minimal additional time . 2 Language Model Integrated Decoding for SCFG We begin by introducing Synchronous Context Free Grammars and their decoding algorithms when an n-gram language model is integrated into the grammatical search space . A synchronous CFG ( SCFG ) is a set of contextfree rewriting rules for recursively generating string pairs . Each synchronous rule is a pair of CFG rules with the nonterminals on the right hand side of one CFG rule being one-to-one mapped to the other CFG rule via a permutation 7r . We adopt the SCFG notation of Satta and Peserico ( 2005 ) . Superscript indices in the right-hand side of grammar rules : indicate that the nonterminals with the same index are linked across the two languages , and will eventually be rewritten by the same rule application . Each Xi is a variable which can take the value of any nonterminal in the grammar .

        "input": "Thus , we are focusing on Inversion Transduction Grammars ( Wu , 1997 ) which are an important subclass of SCFG . Formally , the rules in our grammar include preterminal unary rules : for pairing up words or phrases in the two languages and binary production rules with straight or inverted orders that are responsible for building up upperlevel synchronous structures . They are straight rules written : and inverted rules written : Most practical non-binary SCFGs can be binarized using the synchronous binarization technique by Zhang et al . ( 2006 ) . The Hiero-style rules of ( Chiang , 2005 ) , which are not strictly binary but binary only on nonterminals : can be handled similarly through either offline binarization or allowing a fixed maximum number of gap words between the right hand side nonterminals in the decoder . For these reasons , the parsing problems for more realistic synchronous CFGs such as in Chiang ( 2005 ) and Galley et al . ( 2006 ) are formally equivalent to ITG . Therefore , we believe our focus on ITG for the search efficiency issue is likely to generalize to other SCFG-based methods . Without an n-gram language model , decoding using SCFG is not much different from CFG parsing . At each time a CFG rule is applied on the input string , we apply the synchronized CFG rule for the output language . From a dynamic programming point of view , the DP states are X [ i , j ] , where X ranges over all possible nonterminals and i and j range over 0 to the input string length | w | .

Now the adjacent span-parameterized states X [ i , k ] and X [ k , j ] can interact with each other by peeping into the leading and trailing n 1 words on the output side for each state .

We take the same view as in speech recognition that a trigram integrated model is a finer-grained model than bigram model and in general we can do an n 1 - gram decoding as a predicative pass for the following n-gram pass . We need to do insideoutside parsing as coarse-to-fine parsers do . However , we use the outside probability or cost information differently .",

Instead , for a given finergained state , we combine its true inside cost with the outside cost of its coarse-level counter-part to estimate its worthiness of being explored . The use of the outside cost from a coarser-level as the outside estimate makes our method naturally fall in the framework of A * parsing . Klein and Manning ( 2003 ) describe an A * parsing framework for monolingual parsing and admissible outside estimates that are computed using inside / outside parsing algorithm on simplified PCFGs compared to the original PCFG . Zhang and Gildea ( 2006 ) describe A * for ITG and develop admissible heuristics for both alignment and decoding . Both have shown the effectiveness of A * in situations where the outside estimate approximates the true cost closely such as when the sentences are short . For decoding long sentences , it is difficult to come up with good admissible ( or inadmissible ) heuristics . If we can afford a bigram decoding pass , the outside cost from a bigram model is conceivably a very good estimate of the outside cost using a trigram model since a bigram language model and a trigram language model must be strongly correlated . Although we lose the guarantee that the bigram-pass outside estimate is admissible , we expect that it approximates the outside cost very closely , thus very likely to effectively guide the heuristic search . 3.1 Inside-outside Coarse Level Decoding We describe the coarse level decoding pass in this section .

        "input": "As for normal outside parsing , the operations are the reverse of inside parsing . We propagate the outside cost of the parent to its children by combining with the inside cost of the other children and the interaction cost , i.e. , the language model cost between the focused child and the other children . Since we want to approximate the Viterbi outside cost , it makes sense to maximize over all possible outside costs for a given node , to be consistent with the maximization of the inside pass . For the nodes that have been explored in the bottom up pass but not in the top-down pass , we set their outside cost to be infinity so that their exploration is preferred only when the viable nodes from the first pass have all been explored in the fine pass . 3.2 Heuristics for Fine-grained Decoding In this section , we summarize the heuristics for finer level decoding . The motivation for combining the true inside cost of the fine-grained model and the outside estimate given by the coarse-level parsing is to approximate the true global cost of a fine-grained state as closely as possible . We can make the approximation even closer by incorporating local higherorder outside n-gram information for a state of X [ i , j , u1 , . . , n1 , v1 , . . , n1 ] into account . We call this the best-border estimate . For example , the bestborder estimate for trigram states is : where S ( i , j ) is the set of candidate target language words outside the span of ( i , j ) . hBB is the product of the upper bounds for the two on-the-border n-grams . This heuristic function was one of the admissible heuristics used by Zhang and Gildea ( 2006 ) . The benefit of including the best-border estimate is to refine the outside estimate with respect to the inner words which refine the bigram states into the trigram states .",

When the simple best-border estimate is combined with the coarse-level outside estimate , it can further boost the search as will be shown in the experiments . To summarize , our recipe for faster decoding is that using where is the Viterbi inside cost and is the Viterbi outside cost , to globally prioritize the n-gram integrated states on the agenda for exploration . 3.3 Alternative Efficient Decoding Algorithms The complexity of n-gram integrated decoding for SCFG has been tackled using other methods . The hook trick of Huang et al. ( 2005 ) factorizes the dynamic programming steps and lowers the asymptotic complexity of the n-gram integrated decoding , but has not been implemented in large-scale systems where massive pruning is present . The cube-pruning by Chiang ( 2007 ) and the lazy cube-pruning of Huang and Chiang ( 2007 ) turn the computation of beam pruning of CYK decoders into a top-k selection problem given two columns of translation hypotheses that need to be combined . The insight for doing the expansion top-down lazily is that there is no need to uniformly explore every cell . The algorithm starts with requesting the first best hypothesis from the root . The request translates into requests for the k-bests of some of its children and grandchildren and so on , because re-ranking at each node is needed to get the top ones . Venugopal et al . ( 2007 ) also take a two-pass decoding approach , with the first pass leaving the language model boundary words out of the dynamic programming state , such that only one hypothesis is retained for each span and grammar symbol . 4 Decoding to Maximize BLEU if X → [Y Z] then D the two children are Y [i, k, u, u′] and Z[k, j, v′, v] α(Y [i, k, u, u′]) = max {α(Y [i, k, u, u′]), The ultimate goal of efficient decoding to find the translation that has a highest evaluation score using the least time possible .

But the mismatch between the two is evident , as we will see in the experiments . In this section , we deal with the mismatch by introducing another decoding pass that maximizes the expected count of synchronous constituents in the tree corresponding to the translation returned . BLEU is based on n-gram precision , and since each synchronous constituent in the tree adds a new 4 - gram to the translation at the point where its children are concatenated , the additional pass approximately maximizes BLEU . Kumar and Byrne ( 2004 ) proposed the framework of Minimum Bayesian Risk ( MBR ) decoding that minimizes the expected loss given a loss function . Their MBR decoding is a reranking pass over an nbest list of translations returned by the decoder . Our algorithm is another dynamic programming decoding pass on the trigram forest , and is similar to the parsing algorithm for maximizing expected labelled recall presented by Goodman ( 1996 ) . 4.1 Maximizing the expected count of correct synchronous constituents We introduce an algorithm that maximizes the expected count of correct synchronous constituents . Given a synchronous constituent specified by the state [ X , i , j , u , u , v , v ] , its probability of being correct in the model is where is the outside probability and O is the inside probability . We approximate O and using the Viterbi probabilities .

The classic Expectation Maximization ( EM ) algorithm has been shown to perform poorly on POS tagging , when compared to other techniques , such as Bayesian methods . In this paper , we develop new methods for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging . We adopt the problem formulation of Merialdo ( 1994 ) , in which we are given a raw word sequence and a dictionary of legal tags for each word type . The goal is to tag each word token so as to maximize accuracy against a gold tag sequence . Whether this is a realistic problem set-up is arguable , but an interesting collection of methods and results has accumulated around it , and these can be clearly compared with one another . We use the standard test set for this task , a 24,115 - word subset of the Penn Treebank , for which a gold tag sequence is available . There are 5,878 word types in this test set . We use the standard tag dictionary , consisting of 57,388 word / tag pairs derived from the entire Penn Treebank . 8,910 dictionary entries are relevant to the 5,878 word types in the test set .",

We analyze the tag sequence output produced by EM and try to see where EM goes wrong . The overall POS tag distribution learnt by EM is relatively uniform , as noted by Johnson ( 2007 ) , and it tends to assign equal number of tokens to each tag label whereas the real tag distribution is highly skewed . The Bayesian methods overcome this effect by using priors which favor sparser distributions . But it is not easy to model such priors into EM learning . As a result , EM exploits a lot of rare tags ( like FW = foreign word , or SYM = symbol ) and assigns them to common word types ( in , of , etc . ) . We can compare the tag assignments from the gold tagging and the EM tagging ( Viterbi tag sequence ) . The table below shows tag assignments ( and their counts in parentheses ) for a few word types which occur frequently in the test corpus . We see how the rare tag labels ( like FW , SYM , etc . ) are abused by EM . As a result , many word tokens which occur very frequently in the corpus are incorrectly tagged with rare tags in the EM tagging output .",

With these improvements in mind , we embark on an alternating scheme to find better models and taggings .

In some cases , the model actually gets a reasonable tagging but is penalized perhaps unfairly . For example , to is tagged as IN by our model sometimes when it occurs in the context of a preposition , whereas in the gold tagging it is always tagged as TO . The model also gets penalized for tagging the word U.S. as an adjective ( JJ ) , which might be considered valid in some cases such as the U.S. State Department . In other cases , the model clearly produces incorrect tags ( e.g. , New gets tagged incorrectly as NNPS ) . Our method resembles the classic Minimum Description Length ( MDL ) approach for model selection ( Barron et al. , 1998 ) . In MDL , there is a single objective function to ( 1 ) maximize the likelihood of observing the data , and at the same time ( 2 ) minimize the length of the model description ( which depends on the model size ) .

The method proposed in this paper is the first application of the MDL idea to POS tagging , and the first to use an integer programming formulation rather than heuristic search techniques .

Our method achieves a very high accuracy ( 92.3 % ) on the 45 - tagset and a higher ( 96.8 % ) accuracy on a smaller 17 - tagset . The method works by explicitly minimizing the grammar size using integer programming , and then using EM to estimate parameter values . The entire process is fully automated and yields better performance than any existing state-of-the-art system , even though our models were not provided with any additional linguistic knowledge ( for example , explicit syntactic constraints to avoid certain tag combinations such as V V , etc. ) . However , it is easy to model some of these linguistic constraints ( both at the local and global levels ) directly using integer programming , and this may result in further improvements and lead to new possibilities for future research .

        "input": "Blocked Inference in Bayesian Tree Substitution Grammars Abstract Learning a tree substitution grammar is very challenging due to derivational ambiguity . Our recent approach used a Bayesian non-parametric model to induce good derivations from treebanked input ( Cohn et al . , 2009 ) , biasing towards small grammars composed of small generalisable productions . In this paper we present a novel training method for the model using a blocked Metropolis-Hastings sampler in place of the previous methods local Gibbs sampler . The blocked sampler makes considerably larger moves than the local sampler and consequently converges in less time . A core component of the algorithm is a grammar transformation which represents an infinite tree substitution grammar in a finite context free grammar . This enables efficient blocked inference for training and also improves the parsing algorithm . Both algorithms are shown to improve parsing accuracy . 1 Introduction Tree Substitution Grammar ( TSG ) is a compelling grammar formalism which allows nonterminal rewrites in the form of trees , thereby enabling the modelling of complex linguistic phenomena such as argument frames , lexical agreement and idiomatic phrases . A fundamental problem with TSGs is that they are difficult to estimate , even in the supervised scenario where treebanked data is available . This is because treebanks are typically not annotated with their TSG derivations ( how to decompose a tree into elementary tree fragments ) ; instead the derivation needs to be inferred . In recent work we proposed a TSG model which infers an optimal decomposition under a nonparametric Bayesian prior ( Cohn et al . , 2009 ) .",

Aggregated over the whole corpus , these values and the underlying trees specify the weighted grammar .

The sampler can get easily stuck because many locally improbable decisions are required to escape from a locally optimal solution . This problem manifests itself both locally to a sentence and globally over the training sample . The net result is a sampler that is non-convergent , overly dependent on its initialisation and can not be said to be sampling from the posterior .

The sampler jointly updates all the substitution variables in a tree , making much larger moves than the local single-variable sampler .

The transformed grammar can be used as a proposal distribution , from which samples can be drawn in polynomial time . Empirically , the blocked sampler converges in fewer iterations and in less time than the local Gibbs sampler . In addition , we also show how the transformed grammar can be used for parsing , which yields theoretical and empirical improvements over our previous method which truncated the grammar . 2 Background A Tree Substitution Grammar ( TSG ; Bod et al . ( 2003 ) ) is a 4 - tuple , G = ( T , N , S , R ) , where T is a set of terminal symbols , N is a set of nonterminal symbols , S E N is the distinguished root nonterminal and R is a set of productions ( rules ) . The productions take the form of tree fragments , called elementary trees ( ETs ) , in which each internal node is labelled with a nonterminal and each leaf is labelled with either a terminal or a nonterminal . The frontier nonterminal nodes in each ET form the sites into which other ETs can be substituted . A derivation creates a tree by recursive substitution starting with the root symbol and finishing when there are no remaining frontier nonterminals . Figure 1 ( left ) shows an example derivation where the arrows denote substitution . A Probabilistic Tree Substitution Grammar ( PTSG ) assigns a probability to each rule in the grammar , where each production is assumed to be conditionally independent given its root nonterminal . A derivations probability is the product of the probabilities of the rules therein .",

The inference problem within this model is to identify the posterior distribution of the elementary trees e given whole trees t . The model is characterised by the use of a Dirichlet Process ( DP ) prior over the grammar . We define the distribution over elementary trees e with root nonterminal symbol c as where P0 ( ' | c ) ( the base distribution ) is a distribution over the infinite space of trees rooted with c , and c ( the concentration parameter ) controls the models tendency towards either reusing elementary trees or creating novel ones as each training instance is encountered . Rather than representing the distribution Gc explicitly , we integrate over all possible values of Gc . The key result required for inference is that the conditional distribution of ei , given ei , = e1 ... en \\ ei and the root category c is : where ni ei , c is the number number of times ei has been used to rewrite c in ei , and ni is the total count of rewriting c. Henceforth we omit the i sub - / super-script for brevity . A primary consideration is the definition of P0 . Each ei can be generated in one of two ways : by drawing from the base distribution , where the probability of any particular tree is proportional to cP0 ( ei | c ) , or by drawing from a cache of previous expansions of c , where the probability of any particular expansion is proportional to the number of times that expansion has been used before .

        "input": "In this work we show that if P0 is chosen such that it decomposes with the CFG rules contained within each elementary tree ,1 then we can use a novel dynamic programming algorithm to sample derivations without ever enumerating all the elementary trees in the grammar . The model was trained using a local Gibbs sampler ( Geman and Geman , 1984 ) , a Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) method in which random variables are repeatedly sampled conditioned on the values of all other random variables in the model . To formulate the local sampler , we associate a binary variable with each non-root internal node of each tree in the training set , indicating whether that node is a substitution point or not ( illustrated in Figure 1 ) . The sampler then visits each node in a random schedule and resamples that nodes substitution variable , where the probability of the two different configurations are given by ( 1 ) . Parsing was performed using a MetropolisHastings sampler to draw derivation samples for a string , from which the best tree was recovered . However the sampler used for parsing was biased because it used as its proposal distribution a truncated grammar which excluded all but a handful of the unseen elementary trees . Consequently the proposal had smaller support than the true model , voiding the MCMC convergence proofs . 3 Grammar Transformation We now present a blocked sampler using the Metropolis-Hastings ( MH ) algorithm to perform sentence-level inference , based on the work of Johnson et al . ( 2007 ) who presented a MH sampler for a Bayesian PCFG . This approach repeats the following steps for each sentence in the training set : 1 ) run the inside algorithm ( Lari and Young , 1990 ) to calculate marginal expansion probabilities under a MAP approximation , 2 ) sample an analysis top-down and 3 ) accept or reject using a Metropolis-Hastings ( MH ) test to correct for differences between the MAP proposal and the true model . Though our model is similar to Johnson et al. ( 2007 ) s , we have an added complication : the MAP grammar can not be estimated directly . This is a consequence of the base distribution having infinite support ( assigning non-zero probability to infinitely many unseen tree fragments ) , which means the MAP has an infinite rule set .",

However , we can represent the infinite MAP using a grammar transformation inspired by Goodman ( 2003 ) , which represents the MAP TSG in an equivalent finite PCFG . Under the transformed PCFG inference is efficient , allowing its use as the proposal distribution in a blocked MH sampler . We represent the MAP using the grammar transformation in Table 1 which separates the ne , e and Po terms in ( 1 ) into two separate CFGs , A and B. Grammar A has productions for every ET with ne , e > 1 which are assigned unsmoothed probabilities : omitting the Po term from ( 1 ) . Grammar B has productions for every CFG production licensed under Po ; its productions are denoted using primed ( ) nonterminals . The rule c * c ' bridges from A to B , weighted by the smoothing term excluding Po , which is computed recursively via child productions . The remaining rules in grammar B correspond to every CFG production in the underlying PCFG base distribution , coupled with the binary decision whether or not nonterminal children should be substitution sites ( frontier nonterminals ) . This choice affects the rule probability by including a s or 1 s factor , and child substitution sites also function as a bridge back from grammar B to A . In this way there are often two equivalent paths to reach the same chart cell using the same elementary tree via grammar A using observed TSG productions and via grammar B using Po backoff ; summing these yields the desired net probability .",

Note that although the probabilities exactly match the true model for a single elementary tree , the probability of derivations composed of many elementary trees may not match because the models caching behaviour has been suppressed , i.e. , the counts , n , are not incremented during the course of a derivation .

The same technique was also shown to improve the parsing algorithm . These improvements are in no way limited to our particular choice of a TSG parsing model , many hierarchical Bayesian models have been proposed which would also permit similar optimised samplers . In particular models which induce segmentations of complex structures stand to benefit from this work ; Examples include the word segmentation model of Goldwater et al. ( 2006 ) for which it would be trivial to adapt our technique to develop a blocked sampler . Hierarchical Bayesian segmentation models have also become popular in statistical machine translation where there is a need to learn phrasal translation structures that can be decomposed at the word level ( DeNero et al . , 2008 ; Blunsom et al . , 2009 ; Cohn and Blunsom , 2009 ) . We envisage similar representations being applied to these models to improve their mixing properties . A particularly interesting avenue for further research is to employ our blocked sampler for unsupervised grammar induction .

Its efficient C + + implementation means that memory use and runtime performance are significantly better than comparable decoders . 1 Introduction The dominant models used in machine translation and sequence tagging are formally based on either weighted finite-state transducers ( FSTs ) or weighted synchronous context-free grammars ( SCFGs ) ( Lopez , 2008 ) . Phrase-based models ( Koehn et al . , 2003 ) , lexical translation models ( Brown et al . , 1993 ) , and finite-state conditional random fields ( Sha and Pereira , 2003 ) exemplify the former , and hierarchical phrase-based models the latter ( Chiang , 2007 ) . We introduce a software package called cdec that manipulates both classes in a unified way . Although open source decoders for both phrasebased and hierarchical translation models have been available for several years ( Koehn et al . , 2007 ; Li et al . , 2009 ) , their extensibility to new models and algorithms is limited by two significant design flaws that we have avoided with cdec . First , their implementations tightly couple the translation , language model integration ( which we call rescoring ) , and pruning algorithms . This makes it difficult to explore alternative translation models without also re-implementing rescoring and pruning logic . In cdec , model-specific code is only required to construct a translation forest ( 3 ) .",

Hence all model types benefit immediately from new algorithms ( for rescoring , inference , etc. ) ; new models can be more easily prototyped ; and controlled comparison of models is made easier . Second , existing open source decoders were designed with the traditional phrase-based parameterization using a very small number of dense features ( typically less than 10 ) . cdec has been designed from the ground up to support any parameterization , from those with a handful of dense features up to models with millions of sparse features ( Blunsom et al . , 2008 ; Chiang et al . , 2009 ) . Since the inference algorithms necessary to compute a training objective ( e.g . conditional likelihood or expected BLEU ) and its gradient operate on the unified data structure ( 5 ) , any model type can be trained using with any of the supported training criteria . The software package includes general function optimization utilities that can be used for discriminative training ( 6 ) . These features are implemented without compromising on performance . We show experimentally that cdec uses less memory and time than comparable decoders on a controlled translation task ( 7 ) . 2 Decoder workflow The decoding pipeline consists of two phases . The first ( Figure 1 ) transforms input , which may be represented as a source language sentence , lattice ( Dyer et al. , 2008 ) , or context-free forest ( Dyer and Resnik , 2010 ) , into a translation forest that has been rescored with all applicable models . In cdec , the only model-specific logic is confined to the first step in the process where an input string ( or lattice , etc . ) is transduced into the unified hypergraph representation .

        "input": "Furthermore , prior to language model integration ( and distortion model integration , in the case of phrase based translation ) , pruning is unnecessary for most kinds of models , further simplifying the model-specific code . Once this unscored translation forest has been generated , any non-coaccessible states ( i.e. , states that are not reachable from the goal node ) are removed and the resulting structure is rescored with language models using a user-specified intersection/pruning strategy ( 4 ) resulting in a rescored translation forest and completing phase 1 . The second phase of the decoding pipeline ( depicted in Figure 2 ) computes a value from the rescored forest : 1 - or k-best derivations , feature expectations , or intersection with a target language reference ( sentence or lattice ) . The last option generates an alignment forest , from which a word alignment or feature expectations can be extracted . Most of these values are computed in a time complexity that is linear in the number of edges and nodes in the translation hypergraph using cdecs semiring framework ( 5 ) . 2.1 Alignment forests and alignment Alignment is the process of determining if and how a translation model generates a ( source , target ) string pair . To compute an alignment under a translation model , the phase 1 translation hypergraph is reinterpreted as a synchronous contextfree grammar and then used to parse the target sentence .2 This results in an alignment forest , which is a compact representation of all the derivations of the sentence pair under the translation model . From this forest , the Viterbi or maximum a posteriori word alignment can be generated . This alignment algorithm is explored in depth by Dyer ( 2010 ) . Note that if the phase 1 forest has been pruned in some way , or the grammar does not derive the sentence pair , the target intersection parse may fail , meaning that an alignment will not be recoverable . 3 Translation hypergraphs Recent research has proposed a unified representation for the various translation and tagging formalisms that is based on weighted logic programming ( Lopez , 2009 ) . In this view , translation ( or tagging ) deductions have the structure of a context-free forest , or directed hypergraph , where edges have a single head and 0 or more tail nodes ( Nederhof , 2003 ) .",

In a phrase-based translation hypergraph , the node will correspond to a source coverage vector ( Koehn et al. , 2003 ) .

        "input": "Translation outputs Alignment outputs In the case of SCFG grammars , the edges correspond simply to rules in the synchronous grammar . For non-SCFG translation models , there are two kinds of edges . The first have zero tail nodes ( i.e. , an arity of 0 ) , and correspond to word or phrase translation pairs ( with all translation options existing on edges deriving the same head node ) , or glue rules that glue phrases together . For tagging , word-based , and phrase-based models , these are strictly arranged in a monotone , leftbranching structure . 4 Rescoring with weighted FSTs The design of cdec separates the creation of a translation forest from its rescoring with a language models or similar models . Since the structure of the unified search space is context free ( 3 ) , we use the logic for language model rescoring described by Chiang ( 2007 ) , although any weighted intersection algorithm can be applied . The rescor ing models need not be explicitly represented as FSTsthe state space can be inferred . Although intersection using the Chiang algorithm runs in polynomial time and space , the resulting rescored forest may still be too large to represent completely . cdec therefore supports three pruning strategies that can be used during intersection : full unpruned intersection ( useful for tagging models to incorporate , e.g . , Markov features , but not generally practical for translation ) , cube pruning , and cube growing ( Huang and Chiang , 2007 ) . 5 Semiring framework Semirings are a useful mathematical abstraction for dealing with translation forests since many useful quantities can be computed using a single linear-time algorithm but with different semirings . A semiring is a 5-tuple ( K , , , 0,1 ) that indicates the set from which the values will be drawn , K , a generic addition and multiplication operation , and , and their identities 0 and 1 .

Note that because of our representation , built-in types like double , int , and bool ( together with their default operators ) are semirings .

Thus , many of the semiring types define not only the elements shown in Table 1 but T : : operator < as well .

In particular , by defining a semiring whose values are sets of line segments , having an addition operation equivalent to union , and a multiplication operation equivalent to a linear transformation of the line segments , Ochs line search can be computed simply using the INSIDE algorithm . Since the translation hypergraphs generated by cdec may be quite large making inference expensive , the logic for constructing error surfaces is factored according to the MapReduce programming paradigm ( Dean and Ghemawat , 2004 ) , enabling parallelization across a cluster of machines .

In these models , the translation model is trained to maximize conditional log likelihood of the training data under a specified grammar . Since log likelihood is differentiable with respect to the feature weights in an exponential model , it is possible to use gradient-based optimization techniques to train the system , enabling the parameterization of the model using millions of sparse features . While this training approach was originally proposed for SCFG-based translation models , it can be used to train any model type in cdec . When used with sequential tagging models , this pipeline is identical to traditional sequential CRF training ( Sha and Pereira , 2003 ) . Both the objective ( conditional log likelihood ) and its gradient have the form of a difference in two quantities : each has one term that is computed over the translation hypergraph which is subtracted from the result of the same computation over the alignment hypergraph ( refer to Figures 1 and 2 ) .

        "input": "An Empirical Investigation of Discounting in Cross-Domain Language Models Abstract We investigate the empirical behavior of ngram discounts within and across domains . When a language model is trained and evaluated on two corpora from exactly the same domain , discounts are roughly constant , matching the assumptions of modified Kneser-Ney LMs . However , when training and test corpora diverge , the empirical discount grows essentially as a linear function of the n-gram count . We adapt a Kneser-Ney language model to incorporate such growing discounts , resulting in perplexity improvements over modified Kneser-Ney and Jelinek-Mercer baselines . 1 Introduction Discounting , or subtracting from the count of each n-gram , is one of the core aspects of Kneser-Ney language modeling ( Kneser and Ney , 1995 ) . For all but the smallest n-gram counts , Kneser-Ney uses a single discount , one that does not grow with the ngram count , because such constant-discounting was seen in early experiments on held-out data ( Church and Gale , 1991 ) . However , due to increasing computational power and corpus sizes , language modeling today presents a different set of challenges than it did 20 years ago . In particular , modeling crossdomain effects has become increasingly more important ( Klakow , 2000 ; Moore and Lewis , 2010 ) , and deployed systems must frequently process data that is out-of-domain from the standpoint of the language model . In this work , we perform experiments on heldout data to evaluate how discounting behaves in the cross-domain setting . We find that , when training and testing on corpora that are as similar as possible , empirical discounts indeed do not grow with ngram count , which validates the parametric assumption of Kneser-Ney smoothing . However , when the train and evaluation corpora differ , even slightly , discounts generally exhibit linear growth in the count of the n-gram , with the amount of growth being closely correlated with the corpus divergence .",

We investigate this quantitatively by conducting experiments similar in spirit to those of Church and Gale ( 1991 ) . Suppose that we have collected counts on two corpora of the same size , which we will call our train and test corpora . For an n-gram w = ( wi , . . . , wn ) , let ktrain ( w ) denote the number of occurrences of w in the training corpus , and ktest ( w ) denote the number of occurrences of w in the test corpus . We define the empirical discount of w to be d ( w ) = ktrain ( w ) ktest ( w ) ; this will be negative when the n-gram occurs more in the test data than in the training data . Let Wi = { w : ktrain ( w ) = i } be the set of n-grams with count i in the training corpus . We define the average empirical discount function as Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics : shortpapers , pages 2429 , Portland , Oregon , June 19-24 , 2011 . Kneser-Ney implicitly makes two assumptions : first , that discounts do not depend on n-gram count , i.e . that d ( i ) is constant in i . Modified Kneser-Ney relaxes this assumption slightly by having independent parameters for 1 - count , 2 - count , and manycount n-grams , but still assumes that d ( i ) is constant for i greater than two . Second , by using the same discount for all n-grams with a given count , KneserNey assumes that the distribution of d ( w ) for w in a particular Wi is well-approximated by its mean .",

        "input": "Even within NYT newswire data , we see growing discounts when the train and test corpora are drawn from different years , and between the NYT and AFP newswire , discounts grow even more quickly . We observed these trends continuing steadily up into ngram counts in the hundreds , beyond which point it becomes difficult to robustly estimate discounts due to fewer n-gram types in this count range . This result is surprising in light of the constant discounts observed for the NYT95 / NYT95 ' pair . Goodman ( 2001 ) proposes that discounts arise from document-level burstiness in a corpus , because language often repeats itself locally within a document , and Moore and Quirk ( 2009 ) suggest that discounting also corrects for quantization error due to estimating a continuous distribution using a discrete maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) . Both of these factors are at play in the NYT95 / NYT95 ' experiment , and yet only a small , constant discount is observed . Our growing discounts must therefore be caused by other , larger-scale phenomena , such as shifts in the subjects of news articles over time or in the style of the writing between newswire sources . The increasing rate of discount growth as the source changes and temporal divergence increases lends credence to this hypothesis . 2.2 Nonuniformity of Discounts Figure 1 considers discounting in terms of averaged discounts for each count , which tests one assumption of modified Kneser-Ney , that discounts are a igraip constant function of n-gram counts . In Figure 2 , we investigate the second assumption , namely that the distribution over discounts for a givennn-gram count is well-approximated by its mean . For similar corpora , this seems to be true , with a histogram of test counts for trigrams of count 10 that is nearly symmetric . For divergent corpora , the data exhibit high skew : almost 40 % of the trigrams simply never appear in the test data , and the distribution has very high standard deviation ( 17.0 ) due to a heavy tail ( not shown ) .",

        "input": "Using a discount that depends only on the n-gram count is less appropriate in this case . In combination with the growing discounts of section 2 . 1 , these results point to the fact that modified Kneser-Ney does not faithfully models the discounting in even a mildly cross-domain setting . 2.3 Correlation of Divergence and Discounts Intuitively , corpora that are more temporally distant within a particular newswire source should perhaps be slightly more distinct , and still a higher degree of divergence should exist between corpora from different newswire sources . From Figure 1 , we see that this notion agrees with the relative sizes of the observed discounts . We now ask whether growth in discounts is correlated with train/test dissimilarity in a more quantitative way . For a given pair of corpora , we canonicalize the degree of discounting by selecting the point d ( 30 ) , the average empirical dis count for n-grams occurring 30 times in training .2 To measure divergence between the corpus pair , we compute the difference between the log likelihood of the test corpus under the train corpus language model ( using basic Kneser-Ney ) and the likelihood of the test corpus under a jackknife language model from the test itself , which holds out and scores each test n-gram in turn . This dissimilarity metric resembles the cross-entropy difference used by Moore and Lewis ( 2010 ) to subsample for domain adaptation . We compute this canonicalization for each of twenty pairs of corpora , with each corpus containing 240M trigram tokens between train and test . The corpus pairs were chosen to span varying numbers of newswire sources and lengths of time in order to capture a wide range of corpus divergences . Our results are plotted in Figure 3 . The log likelihood difference and d ( 30 ) are negatively correlated with a correlation coefficient value of r = 0.88 , which strongly supports our hypothesis that higher divergence yields higher discounting .",

        "input": "One explanation for the remaining variance is that the trigram discount curve depends on the difference between the number of bigram types in the train and test corpora , which can be as large as 10 % : observing more bigram contexts in training fragments the token counts 2One could also imagine instead canonicalizing the curves by using either the exponent or slope parameters from a fitted power law as in section 3 . However , there was sufficient nonlinearity in the average empirical discount curves that neither of these parameters was an accurate proxy for d ( i ) . and leads to smaller observed discounts . 2.4 Related Work The results of section 2.1 point to a remarkably pervasive phenomenon of growing empirical discounts , except in the case of extremely similar corpora . Growing discounts of this sort were previously suggested by the model of Teh ( 2006 ) . However , we claim that the discounting phenomenon in our data is fundamentally different from his models prediction . In the held-out experiments of section 2.1 , growing discounts only emerge when one evaluates against a dissimilar held-out corpus , whereas his model would predict discount growth even in NYT95 / NYT95 ' , where we do not observe it . Adaptation across corpora has also been addressed before . Bellegarda ( 2004 ) describes a range of techniques , from interpolation at either the count level or the model level ( Bacchiani and Roark , 2003 ; Bacchiani et al. , 2006 ) to using explicit models of syntax or semantics . Hsu and Glass ( 2008 ) employ a log-linear model for multiplicatively discounting n-grams in Kneser-Ney ; when they include the logcount of an n-gram as the only feature , they achieve 75 % of their overall word error rate reduction , suggesting that predicting discounts based on n-gram count can substantially improve the model . Their work also improves on the second assumption of Kneser-Ney , that of the inadequacy of the average empirical discount as a discount constant , by employing various other features in order to provide other criteria on which to discount n-grams . Taking a different approach , both Klakow ( 2000 ) and Moore and Lewis ( 2010 ) use subsampling to select the domain-relevant portion of a large , general corpus given a small in-domain corpus .",

        "input": "This can be interpreted as a form of hard discounting , and implicitly models both growing discounts , since frequent n-grams will appear in more of the rejected sentences , and nonuniform discounting over n-grams of each count , since the sentences are chosen according to a likelihood criterion . Although we do not consider this second point in constructing our language model , an advantage of our approach over subsampling is that we use our entire training corpus , and in so doing compromise between minimizing errors from data sparsity and accommodating domain shifts to the extent possible . 3 A Growing Discount Language Model We now implement and evaluate a language model that incorporates growing discounts . 3.1 Methods Instead of using a fixed discount for most n-gram counts , as prescribed by modified Kneser-Ney , we discount by an increasing parametric function of the n-gram count . We use a tune set to compute an average empirical discount curve d ( i ) , and fit a function of the form f ( x ) = a + bx ' to this curve using weighted least-Li-loss regression , with the weight for each point proportional to i | Wi | , the total token counts of n-grams occurring that many times in training . To improve the fit of the model , we use dedicated parameters for count - 1 and count - 2 ngrams as in modified Kneser-Ney , yielding a model with five parameters per n-gram order . We call this model GDLM . We also instantiate this model with c fixed to one , so that the model is strictly linear ( GDLM-LIN ) . As baselines for comparison , we use basic interpolated Kneser-Ney ( KNLM ) , with one discount parameter per n-gram order , and modified interpolated Kneser-Ney ( MKNLM ) , with three parameters per n-gram order , as described in ( Chen and Goodman , 1998 ) . We also compare against Jelinek-Mercer smoothing ( JMLM ) , which interpolates the undiscounted MLEs from every order . According to Chen and Goodman ( 1998 ) , it is common to use different interpolation weights depending on the history count of an n-gram , since MLEs based on many samples are presumed to be more accurate than those with few samples . We used five history count buckets so that JMLM would have the same number of parameters as GDLM .",

Parameters for GDLM , MKNLM , and KNLM are initialized based on estimates from d ( i ) : the regression thereof for GDLM , and raw discounts for MKNLM and KNLM . The parameters of JMLM are initialized to constants independent of the data . These initializations are all heuristic and not guaranteed to be optimal , so we then iterate through the parameters of each model several times and perform line search in each to optimize tune-set perplexity . For evaluation , we train , tune , and test on three disjoint corpora . We consider two different training sets : one of 110M words of NYT from 2000 and 2001 ( NYT00 +01 ) , and one of 110M words of AFP from 2002 , 2005 , and 2006 ( AFP02 +05 +06 ) .

This gives us both in-domain and out-of-domain results for our new language model . Our tune set is chosen to be large so that we can initialize parameters based on the average empirical discount curve ; in practice , one could compute empirical discounts based on a smaller tune set with the counts scaled up proportionately , or simply initialize to constant values . We use two different methods to handle out-ofvocabulary ( OOV ) words : one scheme replaces any unigram token occurring fewer than five times in training with an UNK token , yielding a vocabulary of approximately 157K words , and the other scheme only keeps the top 50K words in the vocabulary .",

        "input": "Efficient Search for Transformation-based Inference Abstract This paper addresses the search problem in textual inference , where systems need to infer one piece of text from another . A prominent approach to this task is attempts to transform one text into the other through a sequence of inference-preserving transformations , a.k.a. a proof , while estimating the proofs validity . This raises a search challenge of finding the best possible proof . We explore this challenge through a comprehensive investigation of prominent search algorithms and propose two novel algorithmic components specifically designed for textual inference : a gradient-style evaluation function , and a locallookahead node expansion method . Evaluations , using the open-source system , BIUTEE , show the contribution of these ideas to search efficiency and proof quality . 1 Introduction In many NLP settings it is necessary to identify that a certain semantic inference relation holds between two pieces of text . For example , in paraphrase recognition it is necessary to identify that the meanings of two text fragments are roughly equivalent . In passage retrieval for question answering , it is needed to detect text passages from which a satisfying answer can be inferred . A generic formulation for the inference relation between two texts is given by the Recognizing Textual Entailment ( RTE ) paradigm ( Dagan et al. , 2005 ) , which is adapted here for our investigation . In this setting , a system is given two text fragments , termed text ( T ) and hypothesis ( H ) , and has to recognize whether the hypothesis is entailed by ( inferred from ) the text . An appealing approach to such textual inferences is to explicitly transform T into H , using a sequence of transformations ( Bar-Haim et al. , 2007 ; Harmeling , 2009 ; Mehdad , 2009 ; Wang and Manning , 2010 ; Heilman and Smith , 2010 ; Stern and Dagan , 2011 ) .",

Another example is coreference substitutions , such as replacing he with the employee if a coreference resolver has detected that these two expressions corefer . Table 1 exemplifies this approach for a particular T-H pair . The rationale behind this approach is that each transformation step should preserve inference validity , such that each text generated along this process is indeed inferred from the preceding one . An inherent aspect in transformation-based inference is modeling the certainty that each inference step is valid . This is usually achieved by a costbased or probabilistic model , which quantifies confidence in the validity of each individual transformation and consequently of the complete chain of inference . Given a set of possible transformations , there may be many transformation sequences that would transform T to H . This creates a very large search space , where systems have to find the best transformation sequence the one of lowest cost , or of highest probability . To the best of our knowledge , this search challenge has not been investigated yet in a substan tial manner : each of the above-cited works described the search method they used , but none of them tried alternative methods while evaluating search performance .",

        "input": "Search performance is evaluated on two recent RTE benchmarks , in terms of runtime , ability to find lower-cost transformation chains and impact on overall inference . 2 Background Applying sequences of transformations to recognize textual inference was suggested by several works . Such a sequence may be referred to as a proof , in the sense that it is used to prove the hypothesis from the text . Although various works along this line differ from each other in several respects , many of them share the common challenge of finding an optimal proof . The following paragraphs review the major research approaches in this direction . We focus on methods that perform transformations over parse trees , and highlight the search challenge with which they are faced . 2.1 Transformation-based textual inference Several researchers suggested using various types of transformations in order to derive H from T . Some suggested a set of predefined transformations , for example , insertion , deletion and substitution of parse-tree nodes , by which any tree can be transformed to any other tree . These transformations were used by the open-source system EDITS ( Mehdad , 2009 ) , and by ( Wang and Manning , 2010 ) . Since the above mentioned transformations are limited in capturing certain interesting and prevalent semantic phenomena , an extended set of tree edit operations ( e.g. , relabel-edge , move-sibling , etc. ) was proposed by Heilman and Smith ( 2010 ) . Similarly , Harmeling ( 2009 ) suggested a heuristic set of 28 transformations , which include various types of node-substitutions as well as restructuring of the entire parse-tree . In contrast to such predefined sets of transformations , knowledge oriented approaches were sug gested by Bar-Haim et al. ( 2007 ) and de Salvo Braz et al. ( 2005 ) .",

Typical examples for knowledge resources of such rules are DIRT ( Lin and Pantel , 2001 ) , and TEASE ( Szpektor et al . , 2004 ) , as well as syntactic transformations constructed manually . In addition , they used knowledge-based lexical substitutions . However , when only knowledge-based transformations are allowed , transforming the text into the hypothesis is impossible in many cases . This limitation is dealt by our open-source integrated framework , BIUTEE ( Stern and Dagan , 2011 ) , which incorporates knowledge-based transformations ( entailment rules ) with a set of predefined tree-edits . Motivated by the richer structure and search space provided by BIUTEE , we adopted it for our empirical investigations . The semantic validity of transformation-based inference is usually modeled by defining a cost or a probability estimation for each transformation . Costs may be defined manually ( Kouylekov and Magnini , 2005 ) , but are usually learned automatically ( Harmeling , 2009 ; Mehdad , 2009 ; Wang and Manning , 2010 ; Heilman and Smith , 2010 ; Stern and Dagan , 2011 ) . A global cost ( or probability estimation ) for a complete sequence of transformations is typically defined as the sum of the costs of the involved transformations .

Many search algorithms can be viewed as special cases or variations of best-first search . The well-known A * ( Hart et al . , 1968 ) . algorithm is a best-first search that uses an evaluation function f ( s ) = g ( s ) + h ( s ) . Weighted A * ( Pohl , 1970 ) uses an evaluation function f ( s ) = w g ( s ) + h ( s ) , where w is a parameter , while pure heuristic search uses f ( s ) = h ( s ) . K-BFS ( Felner et al . , 2003 ) expands k states in each iteration . Beam search ( Furcy and Koenig , 2005 ; Zhou and Hansen , 2005 ) limits the number of states stored in OPEN , while Greedy search limits OPEN to contain only the single best state generated in the current iteration . The search algorithm has crucial impact on the quality of proof found by a textual inference system , as well as on its efficiency . Next , we describe search strategies used in prior works for textual inference . 2.3 Search in prior inference models In spite of being a fundamental problem , prior solutions to the search challenge in textual inference were mostly ad-hoc .

Having such a function , the value g ( s ) + h ( s ) estimates the expected total cost of a search path containing s . In our domain , it is yet unclear how to calculate such a heuristic function . Given a state s , systems typically estimate the difference ( the gap ) between s and the hypothesis tH ( the goal state ) . In BIUTEE this is quantified by the number of parse-tree nodes and edges of tH that do not exist in s . However , this does not give an estimation for the expected cost of the path ( the sequence of transformations ) from s to the goal state . This is because the number of nodes and edges that can be changed by a single transformation can vary from a single node to several nodes ( e.g. , by a lexical syntactic entailment rule ) . Moreover , even if two transformations change the same number of nodes and edges , their costs might be significantly different . Consequently , the measurement of the cost accumulated so far ( g ( s ) ) and the remaining gap to tH ( h ( s ) ) are unrelated . We note that a more sophisticated heuristic function was suggested by Heilman and Smith ( 2010 ) , based on tree-kernels .",

Moreover , there is no gain in applying transformations 2 and 3 , unless transformation 4 is applied as well . On the other hand , transformation 1 does not depend on any other transformation . It may be performed at any point along the proof , and moreover , changing all other transformations would not affect it . Carefully examining many examples , we generalized this phenomenon as follows . Often , a sequence of transformations can be decomposed into a set of coherent subsequences of transformations , where in each subsequence the transformations strongly depend on each other , while different subsequences are independent . This phenomenon can be utilized in the following way : instead of searching for a complete sequence of transformations that transform tT into tH , we can iteratively search for independent coherent subsequences of transformations , such that a combination of these subsequences will transform tT into tH . This is somewhat similar to the technique of applying macro operators , which is used in automated planning ( Botea et al. , 2005 ) and puzzle solving ( Korf , 1985 ) . One technique for finding such subsequences is to perform , for each state being expanded , a bruteforce depth-limited search , also known as lookahead ( Russell and Norvig , 2010 ; Bulitko and Lustrek , 2006 ; Korf , 1990 ; Stern et al . , 2010 ) .

        "input": "Learning Translation Consensus with Structured Label Propagation Abstract In this paper , we address the issue for learning better translation consensus in machine translation ( MT ) research , and explore the search of translation consensus from similar , rather than the same , source sentences or their spans . Unlike previous work on this topic , we formulate the problem as structured labeling over a much smaller graph , and we propose a novel structured label propagation for the task . We convert such graph-based translation consensus from similar source strings into useful features both for n-best output reranking and for decoding algorithm . Experimental results show that , our method can significantly improve machine translation performance on both IWSLT and NIST data , compared with a state-ofthe-art baseline . 1 Introduction Consensus in translation has gained more and more attention in recent years . The principle of consensus can be sketched as a translation candidate is deemed more plausible if it is supported by other translation candidates . The actual formulation of the principle depends on whether the translation candidate is a complete sentence or just a span of it , whether the candidate is the same as or similar to the supporting candidates , and whether the supporting candidates come from the same or different MT system . Translation consensus is employed in those minimum Bayes risk ( MBR ) approaches where the loss function of a translation is defined with respect to all other translation candidates . That is , the translation with the minimal Bayes risk is the one to the greatest extent similar to other candidates . These approaches include the work of Kumar and Byrne ( 2004 ) , which re-ranks the nbest output of a MT decoder , and the work of Tromble et al . ( 2008 ) and Kumar et al . ( 2009 ) , which does MBR decoding for lattices and hypergraphs . Others extend consensus among translations from the same MT system to those from different MT systems .",

Hypothesis mixture decoding ( Duan et al . , 2011 ) performs a second decoding process where the search space is enriched with new hypotheses composed out of existing hypotheses from multiple systems . All these approaches are about utilizing consensus among translations for the same ( span of ) source sentence . It should be noted that consensus among translations of similar source sentences/spans is also helpful for good candidate selection . Consider the examples in Figure 1 . For the source ( Chinese ) span _ i Ef n XT X AV , the MT system produced the correct translation for the second sentence , but it failed to do so for the first one . If the translation of the first sentence could take into consideration the translation of the second sentence , which is similar to but not exactly the same as the first one , the final translation output may be improved . Following this line of reasoning , a discriminative learning method is proposed to constrain the translation of an input sentence using ( Chinese to English ) data set . `` Src '' stands for the source sentence , and `` Ref '' means the reference sentence . `` Best1 '' is the final output of the decoder . the most similar translation examples from translation memory ( TM ) systems ( Ma et al. , 2011 ) . A classifier is applied to re-rank the n-best output of a decoder , taking as features the information about the agreement with those similar translation examples .

It is still an open question whether translation consensus for similar sentences/spans can be applied to the decoding process . Moreover , the method in Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff ( 2009 ) is formulated as a typical and simple label propagation , which leads to very large graph , thus making learning and search inefficient . ( c.f. Section 3 . ) In this paper , we attempt to leverage translation consensus among similar ( spans of ) source sentences in bilingual training data , by a novel graph-based model of translation consensus . Unlike Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff ( 2009 ) , we reformulate the task of seeking translation consensus among source sentences as structured labeling . We propose a novel label propagation algorithm for structured labeling , which is much more efficient than simple label propagation , and derive useful MT decoder features out of it . We conduct experiments with IWSLT and NIST data , and experimental results show that , our method can improve the translation performance significantly on both data sets , compared with a state-of-the-art baseline . 2 Graph-based Translation Consensus Our MT system with graph-based translation consensus adopts the conventional log-linear model . For the source string f , the conditional probability of a translation candidate a is defined as : where * is the feature vector , A is the feature weights , and H ( f ) is the set of translation hypotheses in the search space . Based on the commonly used features , two kinds of feature are added to equation ( 1 ) , one is graph-based consensus features , which are about consensus among the translations of similar sentences/spans ; the other is local consensus features , which are about consensus among the translations of the same sentence/span .

A graph is constructed so that each instance is represented by a node , and the weight of the edge between a pair of nodes represents the similarity between them . The gist of graph-based model is that , if two instances are connected by a strong edge , then their labels tend to be the same ( Zhu , 2005 ) . In MT , the instances are source sentences or spans of source sentences , and the possible labels are their translation candidates . This scenario differs from the general case of graph-based model in two aspects . First , there are an indefinite , or even intractable , number of labels . Each of them is a string of words rather than a simple category . In the following we will call these labels as structured labels ( Berlett et al. , 2004 ) .

Therefore , the principle of graph-based translation consensus must be reformulated as , if two instances ( source spans ) are similar , then their labels ( translations ) tend to be similar ( rather than the same ) . Note that Alexandrescu and Kirchhoff ( 2009 ) do not consider translation as structured labeling . In their graph , a node does not represent only a source sentence but a pair of source sentence and its candidate translation , and there are only two possible labels for each node , namely , 1 ( this is a good translation pair ) and 0 ( this is not a good translation pair ) . Thus their graph-based model is a normal example of the general graph-based model . The biggest problem of such a perspective is inefficiency . An average MT decoder considers a vast amount of translation candidates for each source sentence , and therefore the corresponding graph also contains a vast amount of nodes , thus rendering learning over a large dataset is infeasible . 3.1 Label Propagation for General Graphbased Models A general graph-based model is iteratively trained by label propagation , in which , , the probability of label l for the node , is updated with respect to the corresponding probabilities for s neighboring nodes . In Zhu ( 2005 ) , the updating rule is expressed in a matrix calculation . For convenience , the updating rule is expressed for each label here : where , , the propagating probability , is defined as : , defines the weight of the edge , which is a similarity measure between nodes and .

The decoder with new feature weights then provides new n-best candidates and their posteriors for constructing another consensus graph , which in turn gives rise to next round of MERT .

We will divide the discussion into two sections regarding how the graph is used . 5.1 Graph Construction for Re-Ranking When graph-based consensus is used for reranking the n-best outputs of a decoder , each node in the graph corresponds to a complete sentence . A separate node is created for each source sentence in training data , dev data , and test data . For any node from training data ( henceforth training node ) , it is labeled with the correct translation , and pf , e is fixed as 1 . If there are sentence pairs with the same source sentence but different translations , all the translations will be assigned as labels to that source sentence , and the corresponding probabilities are estimated by MLE .

Therefore , the cells in the search space of a decoder can be directly mapped as test nodes in the graph . Training nodes can be handled similarly , by applying forced alignment . Forced alignment performs phrase segmentation and alignment of each sentence pair of the training data using the full translation system as in decoding ( Wuebker et al. , 2010 ) .

Using Struct-LP , the performance is significantly improved , compared with the baseline , but not as well as G-Re-Rank . for IWSLT data set .",

This paper proposes a novel method to predict punctuation symbols for the stream of words in transcribed speech texts . Our method jointly performs parsing and punctuation prediction by integrating a rich set of syntactic features when processing words from left to right . It can exploit a global view to capture long-range dependencies for punctuation prediction with linear complexity . The experimental results on the test data sets of IWSLT and TDT4 show that our method can achieve high-level performance in punctuation prediction over the stream of words in transcribed speech text . 1 Introduction Standard automatic speech recognizers output unstructured streams of words . They neither perform a proper segmentation of the output into sentences , nor predict punctuation symbols . The unavailable punctuations and sentence boundaries in transcribed speech texts create barriers to many subsequent processing tasks , such as summarization , information extraction , question answering and machine translation . Thus , the segmentation of long texts is necessary in many real applications . For example , in speech-to-speech translation , continuously transcribed speech texts need to be segmented before being fed into subsequent machine translation systems ( Takezawa et al. , 1998 ; Nakamura , 2009 ) . This is because current machine translation ( MT ) systems perform the translation at the sentence level , where various models used in MT are trained over segmented sentences and many algorithms inside MT have an exponential complexity with regard to the length of inputs .",

The word-level models integrating local features have narrow views about the input and could not achieve satisfied performance due to the limited context information access ( Favre et al. , 2008 ) . Naturally , global contexts are required to model the punctuation prediction , especially for long-range dependencies . For instance , in English question sentences , the ending question mark is long-range dependent on the initial phrases ( Lu and Ng , 2010 ) , such as could you in Figure 1 . There has been some work trying to incorporate syntactic features to broaden the view of hypotheses in the punctuation prediction models ( Roark et al. , 2006 ; Favre et al. , 2008 ) . In their methods , the punctuation prediction is treated as a separated post-procedure of parsing , which may suffer from the problem of error propagation . In addition , these approaches are not able to incrementally process inputs and are not efficient for very long inputs , especially in the cases of long transcribed speech texts from presentations where the number of streaming words could be larger than hundreds or thousands . In this paper , we propose jointly performing punctuation prediction and transition-based dependency parsing over transcribed speech text . When the transition-based parsing consumes the stream of words left to right with the shift-reduce decoding algorithm , punctuation symbols are predicted for each word based on the contexts of the parsing tree .",

Unlike these works , we incorporate punctuation prediction into the parsing which process left to right input without length limitations . Numerous dependency parsing algorithms have been proposed in the natural language processing community , including transition-based and graph-based dependency parsing . Compared to graph-based parsing , transition-based parsing can offer linear time complexity and easily leverage non-local features in the models ( Yamada and Matsumoto , 2003 ; Nivre et al. , 2006b ; Zhang and Clark , 2008 ; Huang and Sagae , 2010 ) .

The former usually works on a well-formed single sentence while the latter needs to process multiple sentences that are very lengthy . 2 ) .

The stack stores the unfinished words which may be linked with the current word or a future word in the queue . When words in the queue are consumed from left to right , a set of transition actions is applied to build a parse tree . There are four kinds of transition actions conducted in the parsing process ( Zhang and Nivre , 2011 ) , as described in Table 1 . Action Description Shift Fetches the current word from the queue and pushes it to the stack Reduce Pops the stack LeftArc Adds a dependency link from the current word to the stack top , and pops the stack RightArc Adds a dependency link from the stack top to the current word , takes away the current word from the queue and pushes it to the stack The choice of each transition action during the parsing is scored by a linear model that can be trained over a rich set of non-local features extracted from the contexts of the stack , the queue and the set of dependency labels . As described in ( Zhang and Nivre , 2011 ) , the feature templates could be defined over the lexicons , POS-tags and the combinations with syntactic information . In parsing , beam search is performed to search the optimal sequence of transition actions , from which a parse tree is formed ( Zhang and Clark , 2008 ) . As each word must be pushed to the stack once and popped off once , the number of actions needed to parse a sentence is always 2n , where n is the length of the sentence . Thus , transitionbased parsing has a linear complexity with the length of input and naturally it can be extended to process the stream of words . 4 Our method 4.1 Model In the task of punctuation prediction , we are given a stream of words from an automatic transcription of speech text , denoted by 1 : = 1 , 2 , ... , .

Rather than enumerate all possible parsing trees , we jointly optimize the punctuation prediction model and the transition-based parsing model with the form : It is noted that a partial parsing tree uniquely corresponds to a sequence of transition actions , and vice versa . Suppose 1 corresponds to the action sequence 1 and let denote the last action in 1 .

Thus , we synchronize the punctuation prediction with the application of Shift and RightArc during the parsing , which is explained by Model ( 5 ) . The model is further refined by reducing the computation scope . When a full-stop punctuation is determined ( i.e. , a segmentation is formed ) , we discard the previous contexts and restart a new procedure for both parsing and punctuation prediction over the rest of words in the stream .

The training data for both the CPP and UPP models need to contain parsing trees and punctuation information . Due to the absence of annotation over transcribed speech data , we adapt the Treebank data for the purpose of model training . To do this , we remove all types of syntactic information related to punctuation symbols from the raw Treebank data , but record what punctuation symbols are attached to the words . We normalize various punctuation symbols into two types : Middle-paused punctuation ( M ) and Full-stop punctuation ( F ) . Plus null type ( N ) , there are three kinds of punctuation symbols attached to the words . Table 3 illustrates the normalizations of punctuation symbols .",

Similar to work in ( Zhang and Clark , 2008 ; Zhang and Nivre , 2011 ) , we train CPP and UPP by generalized perceptron ( Collins , 2002 ) .

In addition , the global syntactic knowledge used in our work help capture long range dependencies of punctuations . The performance of middle-paused punctuation prediction is fairly low between all methods , which shows predicting middle-paused punctuations is a difficult task .

The last column in Table 4 presents the performance of the pure segmentation task where the middle-paused and full-stop punctuations are mixed and not distinguished . The performance of our method is much higher than that of the baseline , which shows our method is good at segmentation . We also note that UPP yields slightly better performance than CPP on full-stop and mixed punctuation prediction , and much better performance on middle-paused punctuation prediction . This could be because the interaction of parsing and punctuation prediction is closer together in UPP than in CPP . 5.2.2 Performance on automatically recognized text Table 5 shows the experimental results of punctuation prediction on automatically recognized text from TDT4 data that is recognized using SRIs English broadcast news ASR system where the word error rate is estimated to be 18 % .",

Our approach jointly performs parsing and punctuation prediction by integrating a rich set of syntactic features . It can not only yield parse trees , but also determine sentence boundaries and predict punctuation symbols from a global view of the in puts . The proposed algorithm has linear complexity in the size of input , which can efficiently process the stream of words from a purely text processing perspective without the dependences on either the ASR systems or subsequent tasks . The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the CRF-based method on both the correctly recognized and automatically recognized texts . In addition , the performance of the parsing over the stream of transcribed words is state-ofthe-art , which can benefit many subsequent text processing tasks . In future work , we will try our method on other languages such as Chinese and Japanese , where Treebank data is available .

        "input": "Computerized Analysis of a Verbal Fluency Test Abstract We present a system for automated phonetic clustering analysis of cognitive tests of phonemic verbal fluency , on which one must name words starting with a specific letter ( e.g. , F ) for one minute . Test responses are typically subjected to manual phonetic clustering analysis that is labor-intensive and subject to inter-rater variability . Our system provides an automated alternative . In a pilot study , we applied this system to tests of 55 novice and experienced professional fighters ( boxers and mixed martial artists ) and found that experienced fighters produced significantly longer chains of phonetically similar words , while no differences were found in the total number of words produced . These findings are preliminary , but strongly suggest that our system can be used to detect subtle signs of brain damage due to repetitive head trauma in individuals that are otherwise unimpaired . 1 Introduction The neuropsychological test of phonemic verbal fluency ( PVF ) consists of asking the patient to generate as many words as he or she can in a limited time ( usually 60 seconds ) that begin with a specific letter of the alphabet ( Benton et al. , 1989 ) . This test has been used extensively as part of larger cognitive test batteries to study cognitive impairment resulting from a number of neurological conditions , including Parkinsons and Huntingtons diseases , various forms of dementia , and traumatic brain injury ( Troyer et al. , 1998a , b ; Raskin et al. , 1992 ; Ho et al. , 2002 ) . Patients with these disorders tend to generate significantly fewer words on this test than do healthy individuals . Prior studies have also found that clustering ( the degree to which patients generate groups of phonetically similar words ) and switching ( transitioning from one cluster to the next ) behaviors are also sensitive to the effects of these neurological conditions . Contact sports such as boxing , mixed martial arts , football , and hockey are well known for high prevalence of repetitive head trauma . In recent years , the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma in athletes has become the subject of intensive research .",

        "input": "In general , repetitive head trauma is a known risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ) , a devastating and untreatable condition that ultimately results in permanent disability and premature death ( Omalu et al. , 2010 ; Gavett et al. , 2011 ) . However , little is currently known about the relationship between the amount of exposure to head injury and the magnitude of risk for developing these conditions . Furthermore , the development of new behavioral methods aimed at detection of subtle early signs of brain impairment is an active area of research . The PVF test is an excellent target for this research because it is very easy to administer and has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of acute traumatic brain injury ( Raskin and Rearick , 1996 ) . However , a major obstacle to using this test widely for early detection of brain impairment is that clustering and switching analyses needed to detect these subtle changes have to be done manually . These manual approaches are extremely laborintensive , and are therefore limited in the types of clustering analyses that can be performed . Manual methods are also not scalable to large numbers of tests and are subject to inter-rater variability , making the results difficult to compare across subjects , as well as across different studies . Moreover , traditional manual clustering and switching analyses rely primarily on word orthography to determine phonetic similarity ( e.g. , by comparing the first two letters of two words ) , rather than phonetic representations , which would be prohibitively time consuming to obtain by hand . Phonetic similarity has been investigated in application to a number of research areas , including spelling correction ( Toutanova and Moore , 2002 ) , machine translation ( Knight and Graehl , 1998 ; Kondrak et al. , 2003 ) , cross-lingual information retrieval ( Melamed , 1999 ; Fujii and Ishikawa , 2001 ) , language acquisition ( Somers , 1998 ) , historical linguistics ( Raman et al. , 1997 ) , and socialmedia informatics ( Liu et al. , 2012 ) ; we propose a novel clinical application . Our objective was to develop and pilot-test a relatively simple , but robust , system for automatic identification of word clusters , based on phonetic content , that uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary , a decision tree-based algorithm for generating pronunciations for out-of-dictionary words , and two different approaches to calculating phonetic similarity between words .",

CMUdict contains phonetic transcriptions , using a phone set based on ARPABET ( Rabiner and Juang , 1993 ) , for North American English word pronunciations ( Weide , 1998 ) . We used the latest version , cmudict .0.7 a , which contains 133,746 entries . From the full set of entries in CMUdict , we removed alternative pronunciations for each word , leaving a single phonetic representation for each heteronymous set . Additionally , all vowel symbols were stripped of numeric stress markings ( e.g. , AH1 AH ) , and all multicharacter phone symbols were converted to arbitrary singlecharacter symbols , in lowercase to distinguish these symbols from the original single-character ARPABET symbols ( e.g. , AH c ) . Finally , whitespace between the symbols constituting each phonetic representation was removed , yielding compact phonetic-representation strings suitable for computing our similarity measures . To illustrate , the CMUdict pronunciation entry for the word phonetic , [ F AH0 N EH1 T IH0 K ] , would be represented as FcNiTmK . 2.2 Similarity Computation Our system uses two methods for determining phonetic similarity : edit distance and a commonbiphone check . Each of these methods gives a measure of similarity for a pair of phonetic representations , which we respectively call a phoneticsimilarity score ( PSS ) and a common-biphone score ( CBS ) . For PSS , we first compute the Levenshtein distance ( Levenshtein , 1966 ) between compact phonetic-representation strings and normalize that to the length of the longer string ; then , that value is subtracted from 1 . PSS values range from 0 to 1 , with higher scores indicating greater similarity .",

Traditionally , any sequence of n words in a PVF response is deemed to form a cluster if all pairwise word combinations for that sequence are determined to be phonetically similar by some metric . In addition to this method , we developed a less stringent approach in which we define chains instead of clusters . A chain comprises a sequence for which the phonetic representation of each word is similar to that of the word immediately prior to it in the chain ( unless it is chain-initial ) and the word subsequent to it ( unless it is chain-final ) . Lone words that do not belong to any cluster constitute singleton clusters . We call chains based on the editdistance method phonetic chains , and chains based on the common-biphone method common-biphone chains ; both are illustrated in Figure 2 . Unlike the binary CBS method , the PSS method produces continuous edit-distance values , and therefore requires a threshold for categorizing a word pair as similar or dissimilar . We determine the threshold empirically for each letter by taking a random sample of 1000 words starting with that letter in CMUdict , computing PSS scores for each pairwise combination ( n = 499 , 500 ) , and then setting the threshold as the value separating the upper quintile of these scores . With the commonbiphone method , two words are considered phonetically similar simply if their CBS is 1 . 2.4 System Overview Our system is written in Python , and is available online .

Fighters with zero professional fights were assigned a score of 0 ; fighters with between 1 and 15 total fights , but only one or fewer fights per year , were assigned a score of 1 ; fighters with 1-15 total fights , and more than one fight per year , got a score of 2 ; fighters with more than 15 total fights , but only one or fewer fights per year , got a score of 3 ; remaining fighters , with more than 15 fights and more than one fight per year , were assigned the highest score of 4 .

For each clustering method , the differences in means between the groups were tested for statistical significance using one-way ANOVA adjusted for the effects of age and years of education . Spearman correlation was used to test for associations between continuous variables , due to nonlinearity , and to directly compare manually determined clustering measures with corresponding automatically determined chain measures . 4 Results The results of comparisons between the clustering methods , as well as between the low - and highexposure groups , are illustrated in Figure 3.2 We found a significant difference ( p < 0.02 ) in MPSS between the high - and low-exposure groups using the common-biphone method ( 0.15 vs . 0.11 ) , while with edit distance the difference was small ( 0.29 vs . 0.28 ) and not significant ( Figure 3a ) .",

Mean chain sizes determined by the commonbiphone method correlated with manually determined cluster sizes more strongly than did chain sizes determined by edit distance ( = 0.73 , p < 0.01 vs. = 0.48 , p < 0.01 ) . Comparisons of maximum chain and cluster sizes showed a similar pattern ( = 0.71 , p < 0.01 vs. = 0.39 , p < 0.01 ) . Both automatic methods showed significant differences ( p < 0.01 ) between the two groups in MCL and MXCL , with each finding longer chains in the high-exposure group ( Figure 3b , 3c ) ; however , slightly larger differences were observed using the common-biphone method ( MCL : 2.79 vs . 2.21 by common-biphone method , 3.23 vs . 2.80 by edit-distance method ; MXCL : 3.94 vs . 2.64 by common biphone , 4.94 vs . 3.76 by edit distance ) .

Furthermore , as discussed above , automatic analysis is much less labor-intensive , and thus is more scalable to large numbers of tests . Moreover , our system is not prone to human error during analysis , nor to inter-rater variability . Of the two automatic clustering methods , the common-biphone method , which uses binary similarity values , found greater differences between groups in MPSS , MCL , and MXCL ; thus , it appears to be more sensitive than the edit-distance method in detecting group differences . Commonbiphone measures were also found to better correlate with manual measures ; however , both automated methods disagreed with the manual approach to some extent . The fact that the automated common-biphone method shows significant differences between group means , while having less variability in measurements , suggests that it may be a more suitable measure of phonetic clustering than the traditional manual method .",

Other studies that used manual clustering and switching analyses reported significantly more switches for healthy controls than for individuals with neurological conditions ( Troyer et al. , 1997 ) .

Our findings show that the low - and highexposure groups produced similar numbers of words , but the high-exposure group tended to produce longer sequences of phonetically similar words . The latter phenomenon may be interpreted as a mild form of perseverative ( stuck-inset/repetitive ) behavior that is characteristic of disorders involving damage to frontal and subcortical brain structures . To test this interpretation , we correlated MCL and MXCL , the two measures with greatest differences between low - and high-exposure fighters , with the count of repeated words ( RCNT ) .

        "input": "Less Grammar , More Features Abstract We present a parser that relies primarily on extracting information directly from surface spans rather than on propagating information through enriched grammar structure . For example , instead of creating separate grammar symbols to mark the definiteness of an NP , our parser might instead capture the same information from the first word of the NP . Moving context out of the grammar and onto surface features can greatly simplify the structural component of the parser : because so many deep syntactic cues have surface reflexes , our system can still parse accurately with context-free backbones as minimal as Xbar grammars . Keeping the structural backbone simple and moving features to the surface also allows easy adaptation to new languages and even to new tasks . On the SPMRL 2013 multilingual constituency parsing shared task ( Seddah et al. , 2013 ) , our system outperforms the top single parser system of Bjorkelund et al. ( 2013 ) on a range of languages . In addition , despite being designed for syntactic analysis , our system also achieves stateof-the-art numbers on the structural sentiment task of Socher et al. ( 2013 ) . Finally , we show that , in both syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis , many broad linguistic trends can be captured via surface features . 1 Introduction Naive context-free grammars , such as those embodied by standard treebank annotations , do not parse well because their symbols have too little context to constrain their syntactic behavior . For example , to PPs usually attach to verbs and of PPs usually attach to nouns , but a context-free PP symbol can equally well attach to either . Much of the last few decades of parsing research has therefore focused on propagating contextual information from the leaves of the tree to internal nodes . For example , head lexicalization ( Eisner , 1996 ; Collins , 1997 ; Charniak , 1997 ) , structural annotation ( Johnson , 1998 ; Klein and Manning , 2003 ) , and state-splitting ( Matsuzaki et al. , 2005 ; Petrov et al. , 2006 ) are all designed to take coarse symbols like PP and decorate them with additional context .",

        "input": "The underlying reason that such propagation is even needed is that PCFG parsers score trees based on local configurations only , and any information that is not threaded through the tree becomes inaccessible to the scoring function . There have been non-local approaches as well , such as tree-substitution parsers ( Bod , 1993 ; Simaan , 2000 ) , neural net parsers ( Henderson , 2003 ) , and rerankers ( Collins and Koo , 2005 ; Charniak and Johnson , 2005 ; Huang , 2008 ) . These non-local approaches can actually go even further in enriching the grammars structural complexity by coupling larger domains in various ways , though their non-locality generally complicates inference . In this work , we instead try to minimize the structural complexity of the grammar by moving as much context as possible onto local surface features . We examine the position that grammars should not propagate any information that is available from surface strings , since a discriminative parser can access that information directly . We therefore begin with a minimal grammar and iteratively augment it with rich input features that do not enrich the context-free backbone . Previous work has also used surface features in their parsers , but the focus has been on machine learning methods ( Taskar et al. , 2004 ) , latent annotations ( Petrov and Klein , 2008a ; Petrov and Klein , 2008b ) , or implementation ( Finkel et al. , 2008 ) . By contrast , we investigate the extent to which we need a grammar at all . As a thought experiment , consider a parser with no grammar , which functions by independently classifying each span ( i , j ) of a sentence as an NP , VP , and so on , or null if that span is a non-constituent . For example , spans that begin with the might tend to be NPs , while spans that end with of might tend to be non-constituents .",

        "input": "An independent classification approach is actually very viable for part-of-speech tagging ( Toutanova et al. , 2003 ) , but is problematic for parsing if nothing else , parsing comes with a structural requirement that the output be a well-formed , nested tree . Our parser uses a minimal PCFG backbone grammar to ensure a basic level of structural well-formedness , but relies mostly on features of surface spans to drive accuracy . Formally , our model is a CRF where the features factor over anchored rules of a small backbone grammar , as shown in Figure 1 . Some aspects of the parsing problem , such as the tree constraint , are clearly best captured by a PCFG . Others , such as heaviness effects , are naturally captured using surface information . The open question is whether surface features are adequate for key effects like subcategorization , which have deep definitions but regular surface reflexes ( e.g. the preposition selected by a verb will often linearly follow it ) . Empirically , the answer seems to be yes , and our system produces strong results , e.g . up to 90.5 F1 on English parsing . Our parser is also able to generalize well across languages with little tuning : it achieves state-of-the-art results on multilingual parsing , scoring higher than the best single-parser system from the SPMRL 2013 Shared Task on a range of languages , as well as on the competitions average F1 metric . One advantage of a system that relies on surface features and a simple grammar is that it is portable not only across languages but also across tasks to an extent . For example , Socher et al. ( 2013 ) demonstrates that sentiment analysis , which is usually approached as a flat classification task , can be viewed as tree-structured .",

Our parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects . When applied to this task , our system generally matches their accuracy overall and is able to outperform it on the overall sentence-level subtask . 2 Parsing Model In order to exploit non-independent surface features of the input , we use a discriminative formulation . Our model is a conditional random field ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ) over trees , in the same vein as Finkel et al. ( 2008 ) and Petrov and Klein ( 2008a ) . Formally , we define the probability of a tree T conditioned on a sentence w as where the feature domains r range over the ( anchored ) rules used in the tree . An anchored rule r is the conjunction of an unanchored grammar rule rule ( r ) and the start , stop , and split indexes where that rule is anchored , which we refer to as span ( r ) . It is important to note that the richness of the backbone grammar is reflected in the structure of the trees T , while the features that condition directly on the input enter the equation through the anchoring span ( r ) . To optimize model parameters , we use the Adagrad algorithm of Duchi et al . ( 2010 ) with L2 regularization . We start with a simple X-bar grammar whose only symbols are NP , NP-bar , VP , and so on . Our base model has no surface features : formally , on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the ( unanchored ) rule identity , rule ( r ) .",

In past work that has used tree-structured CRFs in this way , increased accuracy partially came from decorating trees T with additional annotations , giving a tree T0 over a more complex symbol set . These annotations introduce additional context into the model , usually capturing linguistic intuition about the factors that influence grammaticality . For instance , we might annotate every constituent X in the tree with its parent Y , giving a tree with symbols X [ Y ] . Finkel et al. ( 2008 ) used parent annotation , head tag annotation , and horizontal sibling annotation together in a single large grammar . In Petrov and Klein ( 2008a ) and Petrov and Klein ( 2008b ) , these annotations were latent ; they were inferred automatically during training . Hall and Klein ( 2012 ) employed both kinds of annotations , along with lexicalized head word annotation . All of these past CRF parsers do also exploit span features , as did the structured margin parser of Taskar et al . ( 2004 ) ; the current work primarily differs in shifting the work from the grammar to the surface features . The problem with rich annotations is that they increase the state space of the grammar substantially . For example , adding parent annotation can square the number of symbols , and each subsequent annotation causes a multiplicative increase in the size of the state space .",

We say that an indicator is a surface property if it can be extracted without reference to the parse tree . These features can be implemented without reference to structured linguistic notions like headedness ; however , we will argue that they still capture a wide range of linguistic phenomena in a data-driven way . Throughout this and the following section , we will draw on motivating examples from the English Penn Treebank , though similar examples could be equally argued for other languages .

A given preterminal unary at position i in the sentence includes features on the words ( suffixes ) at position i 1 , i , and i + 1 . Because the lexicon is especially sensitive to morphological effects , we also fire features on all prefixes and suf fixes of the current word up to length 5 , regardless of frequency .

Because heads of constituents are often at the beginning or the end of a span , these feature templates can ( noisily ) capture monolexical properties of heads without having to incur the inferential cost of lexicalized annotations .

Figure 3 shows an example of one in stance of this feature template . impact is a noun that is more likely to take a PP than other nouns , and so we expect this feature to have high weight and encourage the attachment ; this feature proves generally useful in resolving such cases of rightattachments to noun phrases , since the last word of the noun phrase is often the head . As another example , coordination can be represented by an indicator of the conjunction , which comes immediately after the split point . Finally , control structures with infinitival complements can be captured with a rule S NP VP with the word to at the split point . 4.4 Span Shape Features We add one final feature characterizing the span , which we call span shape . Figure 4 shows how this feature is computed . For each word in the span ,2 we indicate whether that word begins with a capital letter , lowercase letter , digit , or punctuation mark . If it begins with punctuation , we indicate the punctuation mark explicitly . Figure 4 shows that this is especially useful in characterizing constructions such as parentheticals and quoted expressions . Because this feature indicates capitalization , it can also capture properties of NP internal structure relevant to named entities , and its sensitivity to capitalization and punctuation makes it useful for recognizing appositive constructions . 5 Annotations We have built up a strong set of features by this point , but have not yet answered the question of whether or not grammar annotation is useful on top of them . In this section , we examine two of the most commonly used types of additional annotation , structural annotation , and lexical annotation .",

Recall from Section 3 that every span feature is conjoined with indicators over rules and rule parents to produce features over anchored rule productions ; when we consider adding an annotation layer to the grammar , what that does is refine the rule indicators that are conjoined with every span feature . While this is a powerful way of refining features , we show that common successful annotation schemes provide at best modest benefit on top of the base parser . 5.1 Structural Annotation The most basic , well-understood kind of annotation on top of an X-bar grammar is structural annotation , which annotates each nonterminal with properties of its environment ( Johnson , 1998 ; Klein and Manning , 2003 ) . This includes vertical annotation ( parent , grandparent , etc . ) as well as horizontal annotation ( only partially Markovizing rules as opposed to using an X-bar grammar ) . Table 2 shows the performance of our feature set in grammars with several different levels of structural annotation .3 Klein and Manning ( 2003 ) find large gains ( 6 % absolute improvement , 20 % relative improvement ) going from v = 0 , h = 0 to v = 1 , h = 1 ; however , we do not find the same level of benefit . To the extent that our parser needs to make use of extra information in order to apply a rule correctly , simply inspecting the input to determine this information appears to be almost as effective as relying on information threaded through the parser . In Section 6 and Section 7 , we use v = 1 and h = 0 ; we find that v = 1 provides a small , reliable improvement across a range of languages and tasks , whereas other annotations are less clearly beneficial . 3We use v = 0 to indicate no annotation , diverging from the notation in Klein and Manning ( 2003 ) . Test < 40 Test all Berkeley 90.6 90.1 This work 89.9 89.2 5.2 Lexical Annotation Another commonly-used kind of structural annotation is lexicalization ( Eisner , 1996 ; Collins , 1997 ; Charniak , 1997 ) . By annotating grammar nonterminals with their headwords , the idea is to better model phenomena that depend heavily on the semantics of the words involved , such as coordination and PP attachment .

        "input": "One probable reason for this is that our parser already includes monolexical features that inspect the first and last words of each span , which captures the syntactic or the semantic head in many cases or can otherwise provide information about what the constituents type may be and how it is likely to combine . Lexicalization allows us to capture bilexical relationships along dependency arcs , but it has been previously shown that these add only marginal benefit to Collinss model anyway ( Gildea , 2001 ) . 5.3 English Evaluation Finally , Table 3 shows our final evaluation on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank . We use the v = 1 , h = 0 grammar . While we do not do as well as the Berkeley parser , we will see in Section 6 that our parser does a substantially better job of generalizing to other languages . 6 Other Languages Historically , many annotation schemes for parsers have required language-specific engineering : for example , lexicalized parsers require a set of head rules and manually-annotated grammars require detailed analysis of the treebank itself ( Klein and Manning , 2003 ) . A key strength of a parser that does not rely heavily on an annotated grammar is that it may be more portable to other languages . We show that this is indeed the case : on nine languages , our system is competitive with or better than the Berkeley parser , which is the best single the best single parser from ( Bjorkelund et al. , 2013 ) ; we only compare to this parser on the development set because neither the system nor test set values are publicly available .

Unfortunately , Bjorkelund et al .

Of course , a language that was heavily prefixing would likely require this feature to be modified . Likewise , our parser does not perform as well on Arabic and Hebrew . These closely related languages use templatic morphology , for which suffixing is not appropriate ; however , using additional surface features based on the output of a morphological analyzer did not lead to increased performance .

One example is sentiment analysis . While approaches to sentiment analysis often simply classify the sentence monolithically , treating it as a bag of ngrams ( Pang et al. , 2002 ; Pang and Lee , 2005 ; Wang and Manning , 2012 ) , the recent dataset of Socher et al.

        "input": "The grammar rule 2 4 1 already encodes the notion of the sentiment of the right child being dominant , so when this is conjoined with our span feature on the first word ( While ) , we end up with a feature that captures this effect . Our features can also lexicalize on other discourse connectives such as but or however , which often occur at the split point between two spans . 7.1 Adapting to Sentiment Our parser is almost entirely unchanged from the parser that we used for syntactic analysis . Though the treebank grammar is substantially different , with the nonterminals consisting of five integers with very different semantics from syntactic nonterminals , we still find that parent annotation is effective and otherwise additional annotation layers are not useful . One structural difference between sentiment analysis and syntactic parsing lies in where the relevant information is present in a span . Syntax is often driven by heads of constituents , which tend to be located at the beginning or the end , whereas sentiment is more likely to depend on modifiers such as adjectives , which are typically present in the middle of spans . Therefore , we augment our existing model with standard sentiment analysis features that look at unigrams and bigrams in the span ( Wang and Manning , 2012 ) . Moreover , the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is unique in that each constituent was annotated in isolation , meaning that context never affects sentiment and that every word always has the same tag . We exploit this by adding an additional feature template similar to our span shape feature from Section 4.4 which uses the ( deterministic ) tag for each word as its descriptor . 7.2 Results We evaluated our model on the fine-grained sentiment analysis task presented in Socher et al. ( 2013 ) and compare to their released system .

        "input": "Using Discourse Structure Improves Machine Translation Evaluation Abstract We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine translation evaluation . We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures , which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory . Then , we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segment - and at the system-level . Rather than proposing a single new metric , we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics , and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics . 1 Introduction From its foundations , Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) had two defining characteristics : first , translation was modeled as a generative process at the sentence-level . Second , it was purely statistical over words or word sequences and made little to no use of linguistic information . Although modern SMT systems have switched to a discriminative log-linear framework , which allows for additional sources as features , it is generally hard to incorporate dependencies beyond a small window of adjacent words , thus making it difficult to use linguistically-rich models . Recently , there have been two promising research directions for improving SMT and its evaluation : ( a ) by using more structured linguistic information , such as syntax ( Galley et al. , 2004 ; Quirk et al. , 2005 ) , hierarchical structures ( Chiang , 2005 ) , and semantic roles ( Wu and Fung , 2009 ; Lo et al. , 2012 ) , and ( b ) by going beyond the sentence-level , e.g. , translating at the document level ( Hardmeier et al. , 2012 ) . Going beyond the sentence-level is important since sentences rarely stand on their own in a well-written text . Rather , each sentence follows smoothly from the ones before it , and leads into the ones that come afterwards . The logical relationship between sentences carries important information that allows the text to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its separate parts .",

        "input": "Note that sentences can be made of several clauses , which in turn can be interrelated through the same logical relations . Thus , in a coherent text , discourse units ( sentences or clauses ) are logically connected : the meaning of a unit relates to that of the previous and the following units . Discourse analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure underneath the text . Several formal theories of discourse have been proposed to describe the coherence structure ( Mann and Thompson , 1988 ; Asher and Lascarides , 2003 ; Webber , 2004 ) . For example , the Rhetorical Structure Theory ( Mann and Thompson , 1988 ) , or RST , represents text by labeled hierarchical structures called Discourse Trees ( DTs ) , which can incorporate several layers of other linguistic information , e.g . , syntax , predicate-argument structure , etc . . Modeling discourse brings together the above research directions ( a ) and ( b ) , which makes it an attractive goal for MT. This is demonstrated by the establishment of a recent workshop dedicated to Discourse in Machine Translation ( Webber et al. , 2013 ) , collocated with the 2013 annual meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics . The area of discourse analysis for SMT is still nascent and , to the best of our knowledge , no previous research has attempted to use rhetorical structure for SMT or machine translation evaluation . One possible reason could be the unavailability of accurate discourse parsers . However , this situation is likely to change given the most recent advances in automatic discourse analysis ( Joty et al. , 2012 ; Joty et al. , 2013 ) .",

        "input": "We believe that the semantic and pragmatic information captured in the form of DTs ( i ) can help develop discourse-aware SMT systems that produce coherent translations , and ( ii ) can yield better MT evaluation metrics . While in this work we focus on the latter , we think that the former is also within reach , and that SMT systems would benefit from preserving the coherence relations in the source language when generating target-language translations . In this paper , rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric , we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics , and thus should not be ignored . We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures , which use DTs generated by a publiclyavailable discourse parser ( Joty et al . , 2012 ) ; then , we show that they can help improve a number of MT evaluation metrics at the segment - and at the system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the WMT12 metrics shared tasks ( Callison-Burch et al . , 2011 ; Callison-Burch et al . , 2012 ) . These metrics tasks are based on sentence-level evaluation , which arguably can limit the benefits of using global discourse properties . Fortunately , several sentences are long and complex enough to present rich discourse structures connecting their basic clauses . Thus , although limited , this setting is able to demonstrate the potential of discourselevel information for MT evaluation . Furthermore , sentence-level scoring ( i ) is compatible with most translation systems , which work on a sentence-bysentence basis , ( ii ) could be beneficial to modern MT tuning mechanisms such as PRO ( Hopkins and May , 2011 ) and MIRA ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ; Chiang et al . , 2008 ) , which also work at the sentence-level , and ( iii ) could be used for reranking n-best lists of translation hypotheses . 2 Related Work Addressing discourse-level phenomena in machine translation is relatively new as a research direction . Some recent work has looked at anaphora resolution ( Hardmeier and Federico , 2010 ) and discourse connectives ( Cartoni et al. , 2011 ; Meyer , 2011 ) , to mention two examples .1 However , so far the attempts to incorporate discourse-related knowledge in MT have been only moderately successful , at best .

Here we suggest some simple ways to create such metrics , and we also show that they yield better correlation with human judgments .

In the semantic case , there are metrics that exploit the similarity over named entities and predicate-argument structures ( Gimenez and M`arquez , 2007 ; Lo et al. , 2012 ) .

        "input": "In comparison to the syntactic and semantic extensions of MT metrics , there have been very few attempts to incorporate discourse information so far . One example are the semantics-aware metrics of Gimenez and M ` arquez ( 2009 ) and Comelles et al . ( 2010 ) , which use the Discourse Representation Theory ( Kamp and Reyle , 1993 ) and treebased discourse representation structures ( DRS ) produced by a semantic parser . They calculate the similarity between the MT output and references based on DRS subtree matching , as defined in ( Liu and Gildea , 2005 ) , DRS lexical overlap , and DRS morpho-syntactic overlap . However , they could not improve correlation with human judgments , as evaluated on the MetricsMATR dataset . Compared to the previous work , ( i ) we use a different discourse representation ( RST ) , ( ii ) we compare discourse parses using all-subtree kernels ( Collins and Duffy , 2001 ) , ( iii ) we evaluate on much larger datasets , for several language pairs and for multiple metrics , and ( iv ) we do demonstrate better correlation with human judgments . Wong and Kit ( 2012 ) recently proposed an extension of MT metrics with a measure of document-level lexical cohesion ( Halliday and Hasan , 1976 ) . Lexical cohesion is achieved using word repetitions and semantically similar words such as synonyms , hypernyms , and hyponyms . For BLEU and TER , they observed improved correlation with human judgments on the MTC4 dataset when linearly interpolating these metrics with their lexical cohesion score . Unlike their work , which measures lexical cohesion at the document-level , here we are concerned with coherence ( rhetorical ) structure , primarily at the sentence-level . 3 Our Discourse-Based Measures Our working hypothesis is that the similarity between the discourse structures of an automatic and of a reference translation provides additional information that can be valuable for evaluating MT systems .

        "input": "As an example , consider the three discourse trees ( DTs ) shown in Figure 1 : ( a ) for a reference ( human ) translation , and ( b ) and ( c ) for translations of two different systems on the WMT12 test dataset . The leaves of a DT correspond to contiguous atomic text spans , called Elementary Discourse Units or EDUs ( three in Figure 1a ) . Adjacent spans are connected by certain coherence relations ( e.g. , Elaboration , Attribution ) , forming larger discourse units , which in turn are also subject to this relation linking . Discourse units linked by a relation are further distinguished based on their relative importance in the text : nuclei are the core parts of the relation while satellites are supportive ones . Note that the nuclearity and relation labels in the reference translation are also realized in the system translation in ( b ) , but not in ( c ) , which makes ( b ) a better translation compared to ( c ) , according to our hypothesis . We argue that existing metrics that only use lexical and syntactic information can not distinguish well between ( b ) and ( c ) . In order to develop a discourse-aware evaluation metric , we first generate discourse trees for the reference and the system-translated sentences using a discourse parser , and then we measure the similarity between the two discourse trees . We describe these two steps below . 3.1 Generating Discourse Trees In Rhetorical Structure Theory , discourse analysis involves two subtasks : ( i ) discourse segmentation , or breaking the text into a sequence of EDUs , and ( ii ) discourse parsing , or the task of linking the units ( EDUs and larger discourse units ) into labeled discourse trees . Recently , Joty et al. ( 2012 ) proposed discriminative models for both discourse segmentation and discourse parsing at the sentence level . The segmenter uses a maximum entropy model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this task , having an F1 - score of 90.5 % , while human agreement is 98.3 % .",

        "input": "The discourse parser uses a dynamic Conditional Random Field ( Sutton et al . , 2007 ) as a parsing model in order to infer the probability of all possible discourse tree constituents . The inferred ( posterior ) probabilities are then used in a probabilistic CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm to find the most likely DT . Using the standard set of 18 coarse-grained relations defined in ( Carlson and Marcu , 2001 ) , the parser achieved an F1 - score of 79.8 % , which is very close to the human agreement of 83 % . These high scores allowed us to develop successful discourse similarity metrics .2 3.2 Measuring Similarity A number of metrics have been proposed to measure the similarity between two labeled trees , e.g . , Tree Edit Distance ( Tai , 1979 ) and Tree Kernels ( Collins and Duffy , 2001 ; Moschitti and Basili , 2006 ) . Tree kernels ( TKs ) provide an effective way to integrate arbitrary tree structures in kernelbased machine learning algorithms like SVMs . In the present work , we use the convolution TK defined in ( Collins and Duffy , 2001 ) , which efficiently calculates the number of common subtrees in two trees . Note that this kernel was originally designed for syntactic parsing , where the subtrees are subject to the constraint that their nodes are taken with either all or none of the children . This constraint of the TK imposes some limitations on the type of substructures that can be compared . One way to cope with the limitations of the TK is to change the representation of the trees to a form that is suitable to capture the relevant information for our task . We experiment with TKs applied to two different representations of the discourse tree : non-lexicalized ( DR ) , and lexicalized ( DR-LEX ) .",

As shown in Figure 2a , DR does not include any lexical item , and therefore measures the similarity between two translations in terms of their discourse structures only . On the contrary , DR-LEX includes the lexical items to account for lexical matching ; moreover , it separates the structure ( the skeleton ) of the tree from its labels , i.e. the nuclearity and the relations , in order to allow the tree kernel to give partial credit to subtrees that differ in labels but match in their skeletons . More specifically , it uses the tags SPAN and EDU to build the skeleton of the tree , and considers the nuclearity and/or the relation labels as properties , added as children , of these tags . For example , a SPAN has two properties ( its nuclearity and its relation ) , and an EDU has one property ( its nuclearity ) . The words of an EDU are placed under the predefined children NGRAM . In order to allow the tree kernel to find subtree matches at the word level , we include an additional layer of dummy leaves as was done in ( Moschitti et al. , 2007 ) ; not shown in Figure 2 , for simplicity . 4 Experimental Setup In our experiments , we used the data available for the WMT12 and the WMT11 metrics shared tasks for translations into English .

This is a uniform linear combination of 12 individual metrics . From the original ULC , we only replaced TER and Meteor individual metrics by newer versions taking into account synonymy lookup and paraphrasing : TERp-A and METEOR-pa in ASIYAs terminology . We will call this combined metric Asiya0809 in our experiments . To complement the set of individual metrics that participated at the WMT12 metrics task , we also computed the scores of other commonlyused evaluation metrics : BLEU ( Papineni et al . , 2002 ) , NIST ( Doddington , 2002 ) , TER ( Snover et al . , 2006 ) , ROUGE-W ( Lin , 2004 ) , and three METEOR variants ( Denkowski and Lavie , 2011 ) : METEOR-ex ( exact match ) , METEOR-st ( + stemming ) and METEOR-sy ( + synonyms ) . The uniform linear combination of the previous 7 individual metrics plus the 12 from Asiya - 0809 is reported as Asiya-ALL in the experimental section . The individual metrics combined in Asiya-ALL can be naturally categorized according to the type of linguistic information they use to compute the quality scores . We grouped them in the following four families and calculated the uniform linear combination of the metrics in each group : All uniform linear combinations are calculated outside ASIYA .

As a result , for each source sentence , only relative rankings were available . As in the WMT12 experimental setup , we use these rankings to calculate correlation with human judgments at the sentencelevel , i.e . Kendalls Tau ; see ( Callison-Burch et al . , 2012 ) for details . For the experiments reported in Section 5.4 , we used pairwise rankings to discriminatively learn the weights of the linear combinations of individual metrics . In order to use the WMT12 data for training a learning-to-rank model , we transformed the five-way relative rankings into ten pairwise comparisons . For instance , if a judge ranked the output of systems A , B , C , D , E as A > B > C > D > E , this would entail that A > B , A > C , A > D and A > E , etc. . To determine the relative weights for the tuned combinations , we followed a similar approach to the one used by PRO to tune the relative weights of the components of a log-linear SMT model ( Hopkins and May , 2011 ) , also using Maximum Entropy as the base learning algorithm . Unlike PRO , ( i ) we use human judgments , not automatic scores , and ( ii ) we train on all pairs , not on a subsample . 5 Experimental Results In this section , we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation evaluation metrics .

As expected , DR-LEX performs better than DR since it is lexicalized ( at the unigram level ) , and also gives partial credit to correct structures .

These improvements are very close to those for the WMT12 cross-validation . This shows that the weights learned on WMT12 generalize well , as they are also good for WMT11 . What is also interesting to note is that when tuning is used , DR helps achieve sizeable improvements , even if not as strong as for DR-LEX .

Overall , from the experimental results in this section , we can conclude that discourse structure is an important information source to be taken into account in the automatic evaluation of machine translation output . 6 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have shown that discourse structure can be used to improve automatic MT evaluation . First , we defined two simple discourse-aware similarity metrics ( lexicalized and un-lexicalized ) , which use the all-subtree kernel to compute similarity between discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory . Then , after extensive experimentation on WMT12 and WMT11 data , we showed that a variety of existing evaluation metrics can benefit from our discourse-based metrics , both at the segment - and the system-level , especially when the discourse information is incorporated in an informed way ( i.e . using supervised tuning ) . Our results show that discourse-based metrics can improve the state-ofthe-art MT metrics , by increasing correlation with human judgments , even when only sentence-level discourse information is used .",

First , at the sentence-level , we can use discourse information to re-rank alternative MT hypotheses ; this could be applied either for MT parameter tuning , or as a post-processing step for the MT output .

        "input": "Data Recombination for Neural Semantic Parsing Abstract Modeling crisp logical regularities is crucial in semantic parsing, making it difficult for neural models with no task-specific prior knowledge to achieve good results. In this paper, we introduce data recombination, a novel framework for injecting such prior knowledge into a model. From the training data , we induce a high-precision synchronous context-free grammar , which captures important conditional independence properties commonly found in semantic parsing . We then train a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network ( RNN ) model with a novel attention-based copying mechanism on datapoints sampled from this grammar , thereby teaching the model about these structural properties . Data recombination improves the accuracy of our RNN model on three semantic parsing datasets , leading to new state-of-the-art performance on the standard GeoQuery dataset for models with comparable supervision . 1 Introduction Semantic parsing—the precise translation of natural language utterances into logical forms—has many applications, including question answering ( Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Liang et al., 2011; Berant et al., 2013 ), instruction following ( Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013b ), and regular expression generation ( Kushman and Barzilay, 2013 ). Modern semantic parsers ( Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013a; Berant et al., 2013 ) are complex pieces of software, requiring handcrafted features, lexicons, and grammars. Meanwhile , recurrent neural networks ( RNNs ) have made swift inroads into many structured prediction tasks in NLP , including machine translation ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ; Bahdanau et al . , 2014 ) and syntactic parsing ( Vinyals et al . , 2015b ; Dyer et al . , 2015 ) . Because RNNs make very few domain-specific assumptions , they have the potential to succeed at a wide variety of tasks with minimal feature engineering . However , this flexibility also puts RNNs at a disadvantage compared to standard semantic parsers , which can generalize naturally by leveraging their built-in awareness of logical compositionality . In this paper, we introduce data recombination, a generic framework for declaratively injecting prior knowledge into a domain-general structured prediction model.",

Samples from this generative model are then used to train a domain-general model. In the case of semantic parsing , we construct a generative model by inducing a synchronous context-free grammar ( SCFG ) , creating new examples such as those shown in Figure 1 ; our domain-general model is a sequence-to-sequence RNN with a novel attention-based copying mechanism . Data recombination boosts the accuracy of our RNN model on three semantic parsing datasets . On the GEO dataset , data recombination improves test accuracy by 4.3 percentage points over our baseline RNN , leading to new state-of-the-art results for models that do not use a seed lexicon for predicates . 2 Problem statement We cast semantic parsing as a sequence-to-sequence task. The input utterance x is a sequence of words x1, . . . , xm ∈ V ( in ), the input vocabulary; similarly, the output logical form y is a sequence of tokens y1, . . . , yn ∈ V ( out ), the output vocabulary. A linear sequence of tokens might appear to lose the hierarchical structure of a logical form , but there is precedent for this choice : Vinyals et al . ( 2015b ) showed that an RNN can reliably predict tree-structured outputs in a linear fashion . We evaluate our system on three existing semantic parsing datasets.

While our system cannot directly learn from denotations, it could be used to rerank candidate derivations generated by one of these other systems. 3 Sequence-to-sequence RNN Model Our sequence-to-sequence RNN model is based on existing attention-based neural machine translation models ( Bahdanau et al . , 2014 ; Luong et al . , 2015a ) , but also includes a novel attention-based copying mechanism .",

First, a word embedding function φ( in ) maps each word xi to a fixed-dimensional vector. These vectors are fed as input to two RNNs : a forward RNN and a backward RNN .

They are computed from the unnormalized attention scores eji. The matrices W ( s ), W ( a ), and U , as well as the embedding function φ( out ), are parameters of the model. 3.2 Attention-based Copying In the basic model of the previous section, the next output word yj is chosen via a simple softmax over all words in the output vocabulary. However, this model has difficulty generalizing to the long tail of entity names commonly found in semantic parsing datasets. Conveniently, entity names in the input often correspond directly to tokens in the output ( e.g., “iowa” becomes iowa in Figure 2 ). To capture this intuition , we introduce a new attention-based copying mechanism . At each time step j, the decoder generates one of two types of actions.

The decoder chooses aj with a softmax over all these possible actions; yj is then a deterministic function of aj and x. During training, we maximize the log-likelihood of y, marginalizing out a.

In this framework, we induce a high-precision generative model from the training data, then sample from it to generate new training examples. The process of inducing this generative model can leverage any available prior knowledge , which is transmitted through the generated examples to the RNN model . A key advantage of our two-stage approach is that it allows us to declare desired properties of the task which might be hard to capture in the model architecture. Our approach generalizes data augmentation, which is commonly employed to inject prior knowledge into a model.",

        "input": "Data augmentation techniques focus on modeling invariances— transformations like translating an image or adding noise that alter the inputs x, but do not change the output y. These techniques have proven effective in areas like computer vision ( Krizhevsky et al., 2012 ) and speech recognition ( Jaitly and Hinton, 2013 ). In semantic parsing, however, we would like to capture more than just invariance properties. Consider an example with the utterance “what states border texas ? ”. Given this example, it should be easy to generalize to questions where “texas” is replaced by the name of any other state: simply replace the mention of Texas in the logical form with the name of the new state. Underlying this phenomenon is a strong conditional independence principle: the meaning of the rest of the sentence is independent of the name of the state in question. Standard data augmentation is not sufficient to model such phenomena: instead of holding y fixed, we would like to apply simultaneous transformations to x and y such that the new x still maps to the new y. Data recombination addresses this need. 4.2 General Setting In the general setting of data recombination, we start with a training set D of ( x, y ) pairs, which defines the empirical distribution pˆ( x, y ). We then fit a generative model p˜( x, y ) to pˆ which generalizes beyond the support of pˆ, for example by splicing together fragments of different examples.

        "input": "Finally, to train our actual model pθ( y | x ), we maximize the expected value of log pθ( y | x ), where ( x, y ) is drawn from p˜. 4.3 SCFGs for Semantic Parsing For semantic parsing , we induce a synchronous context-free grammar ( SCFG ) to serve as the backbone of our generative model p ˜ . An SCFG consists of a set of production rules X → 〈 α , β 〉 , whereX is a category ( non-terminal ) , and α and β are sequences of terminal and non-terminal symbols . Any non-terminal symbols in α must be aligned to the same non-terminal symbol in β, and vice versa. Therefore , an SCFG defines a set of joint derivations of aligned pairs of strings . In our case , we use an SCFG to represent joint derivations of utterances x and logical forms y ( which for us is just a sequence of tokens ) . After we induce an SCFG G from D , the corresponding generative model p ˜ ( x , y ) is the distribution over pairs ( x , y ) defined by sampling from G , where we choose production rules to apply uniformly at random . It is instructive to compare our SCFG-based data recombination with WASP ( Wong and Mooney , 2006 ; Wong and Mooney , 2007 ) , which uses an SCFG as the actual semantic parsing model . The grammar induced by WASP must have good coverage in order to generalize to new inputs at test time . WASP also requires the implementation of an efficient algorithm for computing the conditional probability p ( y | x ) . In contrast , our SCFG is only used to convey prior knowledge about conditional independence structure , so it only needs to have high precision ; our RNN model is responsible for boosting recall over the entire input space .",

        "input": "We also only need to forward sample from the SCFG , which is considerably easier to implement than conditional inference . Below, we examine various strategies for inducing a grammar G from a dataset D. We first encode D as an initial grammar with rules ROOT → 〈x, y〉 for each ( x, y ) ∈ D. Next, we will define each grammar induction strategy as a mapping from an input grammar Gin to a new grammar Gout. This formulation allows us to compose grammar induction strategies ( Section 4.3.4 ). 4.3.1 Abstracting Entities Our first grammar induction strategy , ABSENTI-TIES , simply abstracts entities with their types . We assume that each entity e ( e.g., texas ) has a corresponding type e.t ( e.g., state ), which we infer based on the presence of certain predicates in the logical form ( e.g. stateid ). For each grammar rule X → 〈α, β〉 in Gin, where α contains a token ( e.g., “texas” ) that string matches an entity ( e.g., texas ) in β, we add two rules to Gout: ( i ) a rule where both occurrences are replaced with the type of the entity ( e.g., state ), and ( ii ) a new rule that maps the type to the entity ( e.g., STATEID → 〈“texas”,texas〉; we reserve the category name STATE for the next section ). Thus, Gout generates recombinant examples that fuse most of one example with an entity found in a second example. A concrete example from the GEO domain is given in Figure 3 . 4.3.2 Abstracting Whole Phrases Our second grammar induction strategy , ABSW-HOLEPHRASES , abstracts both entities and whole phrases with their types . For each grammar rule X → 〈α, β〉 in Gin, we add up to two rules to Gout.",

Second, if we can infer that the entire expression β evaluates to a set of a particular type ( e.g. state ) we create a rule that maps the type to 〈α, β〉. In practice, we also use some simple rules to strip question identifiers from α, so that the resulting examples are more natural. Again, refer to Figure 3 for a concrete example. This strategy works because of a more general conditional independence property: the meaning of any semantically coherent phrase is conditionally independent of the rest of the sentence, the cornerstone of compositional semantics. Note that this assumption is not always correct in general: for example, phenomena like anaphora that involve long-range context dependence violate this assumption. However, this property holds in most existing semantic parsing datasets. 4.3.3 Concatenation The final grammar induction strategy is a surprisingly simple approach we tried that turns out to work. For any k ≥ 2 , we define the CONCAT-k strategy , which creates two types of rules . First, we create a single rule that has ROOT going to a sequence of k SENT’s. Then, for each rootlevel rule ROOT → 〈α, β〉 in Gin, we add the rule SENT → 〈α, β〉 to Gout.",

Of course, it also does not introduce additional information about compositionality or independence properties present in semantic parsing. However , it does generate harder examples for the attention-based RNN , since the model must learn to attend to the correct parts of the now-longer input sequence . Related work has shown that training a model on more difficult examples can improve generalization, the most canonical case being dropout ( Hinton et al., 2012; Wager et al., 2013 ). 4.3.4 Composition We note that grammar induction strategies can be composed, yielding more complex grammars. Given any two grammar induction strategies f1 and f2, the composition f1 ◦ f2 is the grammar induction strategy that takes in Gin and returns f1( f2( Gin ) ). For the strategies we have defined, we can perform this operation symbolically on the grammar rules, without having to sample from the intermediate grammar f2( Gin ). 5 Experiments We evaluate our system on three domains : GEO , ATIS , and OVERNIGHT . For ATIS , we report logical form exact match accuracy . For GEO and OVERNIGHT , we determine correctness based on denotation match , as in Liang et al . ( 2011 ) and Wang et al .

We prevent copying by prepending underscores to predicate tokens; see Figure 2 for examples. On ATIS alone , when doing attention-based copying and data recombination , we leverage an external lexicon that maps natural language phrases ( e.g . , “ kennedy airport ” ) to entities ( e.g . , jfk : ap ) . When we copy a word that is part of a phrase in the lexicon, we write the entity associated with that lexicon entry. When performing data recombination, we identify entity alignments based on matching phrases and entities from the lexicon. We run all experiments with 200 hidden units and 100-dimensional word vectors. We initialize all parameters uniformly at random within the interval [−0.1, 0.1].

We add these examples to the original training dataset, randomly shuffle all examples, and train the model for the epoch. Figure 4 gives pseudocode for this training procedure. One important hyperparameter is how many examples to sample at each epoch: we found that a good rule of thumb is to sample as many recombinant examples as there are examples in the training dataset, so that half of the examples the model sees at each epoch are recombinant. At test time , we use beam search with beam size 5 . We automatically balance missing right parentheses by adding them at the end. On GEO and OVERNIGHT , we then pick the highest-scoring logical form that does not yield an executor error when the corresponding denotation is computed . On ATIS , we just pick the top prediction on the beam . 5.3 Impact of the Copying Mechanism First , we measure the contribution of the attention-based copying mechanism to the model ’ s overall performance .",

        "input": "However , no data recombination strategy improved average test accuracy on OVERNIGHT ; the best one resulted in a 0.3 percentage point decrease in test accuracy . We hypothesize that data recombination helps less on OVERNIGHT in general because the space of possible logical forms is very limited , making it more like a large multiclass classification task . Therefore, it is less important for the model to learn good compositional representations that generalize to new logical forms at test time. 5.5 Effect of Longer Examples Interestingly , strategies like ABSWHOLE-PHRASES and CONCAT - 2 help the model even though the resulting recombinant examples are generally not in the support of the test distribution . In particular , these recombinant examples are on average longer than those in the actual dataset , which makes them harder for the attention-based model . Indeed , for every domain , our best accuracy numbers involved some form of concatenation , and often involved ABSWHOLEPHRASES as well . In comparison , applying ABSENTITIES alone , which generates examples of the same length as those in the original dataset , was generally less effective . We conducted additional experiments on artificial data to investigate the importance of adding longer, harder examples. We experimented with adding new examples via data recombination, as well as adding new independent examples ( e.g. to simulate the acquisition of more training data ).

There has been growing interest in applying neural networks to semantic parsing and related tasks. Dong and Lapata ( 2016 ) concurrently developed an attention-based RNN model for semantic parsing , although they did not use data recombination . Grefenstette et al .

Our proposed attention-based copying mechanism bears a strong resemblance to two models that were developed independently by other groups . Gu et al . ( 2016 ) apply a very similar copying mechanism to text summarization and singleturn dialogue generation . Gulcehre et al.

Unlike our data recombination strategies, these techniques only change inputs x, while keeping the labels y fixed. Additionally, these paraphrasing-based transformations can be described in terms of grammar induction, so they can be incorporated into our framework. In data recombination, data generated by a high-precision generative model is used to train a second, domain-general model. Generative oversampling ( Liu et al., 2007 ) learns a generative model in a multiclass classification setting, then uses it to generate additional examples from rare classes in order to combat label imbalance.

        "input": "DocChat: An Information Retrieval Approach for Chatbot Engines Using Unstructured Documents Abstract Most current chatbot engines are designed to reply to user utterances based on existing utterance-response ( or Q-R )1 pairs. In this paper , we present DocChat , a novel information retrieval approach for chatbot engines that can leverage unstructured documents , instead of Q-R pairs , to respond to utterances . A learning to rank model with features designed at different levels of granularity is proposed to measure the relevance between utterances and responses directly. We evaluate our proposed approach in both English and Chinese: ( i ) For English , we evaluate Doc-Chat on WikiQA and QASent , two answer sentence selection tasks , and compare it with state-of-the-art methods . Reasonable improvements and good adaptability are observed. ( ii ) For Chinese , we compare DocChat with XiaoIce2 , a famous chitchat engine in China , and side-by-side evaluation shows that DocChat is a perfect complement for chatbot engines using Q-R pairs as main source of responses . 1 Introduction Building chatbot engines that can interact with humans with natural language is one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence. Along with the explosive growth of social media, like community question answering ( CQA ) websites ( e.g., Yahoo Answers and WikiAnswers ) and social media websites ( e.g., Twitter and Weibo ), the amount of utterance-response ( or Q-R ) pairs has experienced massive growth in recent years, and such a corpus greatly promotes the emergence of various data-driven chatbot approaches. Instead of multiple rounds of conversation, we only consider a much simplified task, short text conversation ( STC ) in which the response R is a short text and only depends on the last user utteranceQ. Previous methods for the STC task mostly rely on Q-R pairs and fall into two categories: Retrieval-based methods ( e.g., Ji et al., 2014 ). This type of methods first retrieve the most possible 〈Qˆ, Rˆ〉 pair from a set of existing Q-R pairs, which best matches current utterance Q based on semantic matching models, then take Rˆ as the response R. One disadvantage of such a method is that, for many specific domains, collecting such Q-R pairs is intractable.",

        "input": "Generation based methods ( e.g., Shang et al., 2015 ). This type of methods usually uses an encoder-decoder framework which first encode Q as a vector representation, then feed this representation to decoder to generate response R. Similar to retrieval-based methods, such approaches also depend on existing Q-R pairs as training data. Like other language generation tasks, such as machine translation and paraphrasing, the fluency and naturality of machine generated text is another drawback. To overcome the issues mentioned above , we present a novel response retrieval approach , DocChat , to find responses based on unstructured documents . For each user utterance, instead of looking for the best Q-R pair or generating a word sequence based on language generation techniques, our method selects a sentence from given documents directly, by ranking all possible sentences based on features designed at different levels of granularity. On one hand, using documents rather than Q-R pairs greatly improve the adaptability of chatbot engines on different chatting topics. On the other hand, all responses come from existing documents, which guarantees their fluency and naturality. We also show promising results in experiments, on both QA and chatbot scenarios. 2 Task Description Formally, given an utteranceQ and a document set D, the document-based chatbot engine retrieves responseR based on the following three steps: response retrieval, which retrieves response candidates C from D based on Q. Each S ∈ C is a sentence existing in D. response ranking, which ranks all response candidates in C and selects the most possible response candidate as Sˆ, response triggering, which decides whether it is confident enough to responseQ using Sˆ: where I is a binary value.",

        "input": "When I equals to true, let the response R = Sˆ and output R; otherwise, output nothing. In the following three sections, we will describe solutions of these three components one by one. 3 Response Retrieval Given a user utterance Q, the goal of response retrieval is to efficiently find a small number of sentences fromD, which have high possibility to contain suitable sentences as Q’s response. Although it is not necessarily true that a good response always shares more words with a given utterance, this measurement is still helpful in finding possible response candidates ( Ji et al., 2014 ). In this paper, the BM25 term weighting formulas ( Jones et al., 2000 ) is used to retrieve response candidates from documents. Given each document Dk ∈ D, we collect a set of sentence triples 〈Sprev,S,Snext〉 fromDk, where S denotes a sentence in Dk, Sprev and Snext denote S’s previous sentence and next sentence respectively. Two special tags, 〈BOD〉 and 〈EOD〉, are added at the beginning and end of each passage, to make sure that such sentence triples can be extracted for every sentence in the document. The reason for indexing each sentence together with its context sentences is intuitive: If a sentence within a document can respond to an utterance, then its context should be revelent to the utterance as well. 4 Response Ranking Given a user utteranceQ and a response candidate S, the ranking function Rank( S,Q ) is designed as an ensemble of individual matching features: where hk( · ) denotes the k-th feature function, λk denotes hk( · )’s corresponding weight. We design features at different levels of granularity to measure the relevance between S and Q, including word-level, phrase-level, sentencelevel, document-level, relation-level, type-level and topic-level, which will be introduced below. 4.1 Word-level Feature We define three word-level features in this work: ( 1 ) hWM ( S,Q ) denotes a word matching feature that counts the number ( weighted by the IDF value of each word in S ) of non-stopwords shared by S and Q. ( 2 ) hW2W ( S , Q ) denotes a word-to-word translation-based feature that calculates the IBM model 1 score ( Brown et al . , 1993 ) of S and Q based on word alignments trained on ‘ question-related question ’ pairs using GIZA + + ( Och and Ney , 2003 ) . ( 3 ) hW2V ( S,Q ) denotes a word embedding-based feature that calculates the average cosine distance between word embeddings of all non-stopword pairs 〈vSj , vQi〉. vSj represent the word vector of jth word in S and vQj represent the word vector of ith word in Q. 4.2 Phrase-level Feature 4.2.1 Paraphrase We first describe how to extract phrase-level paraphrases from an existing SMT ( statistical machine translation ) phrase table . PT = {〈si, ti, p( ti|si ), p( si|ti )〉}3 is a phrase table, which is extracted from a bilingual corpus, where si ( or ti ) denotes a phrase, in source ( or target ) language, p( ti|si ) ( or p( si|ti ) ) denotes the translation probability from si ( or ti ) to ti ( or si ). We follow Bannard and Callison-Burch ( 2005 ) to extract a paraphrase table PP = {〈si, sj , score( sj ; si )〉}. si and sj denote two phrases in source language, score( sj ; si ) denotes a confidence score that si can be paraphrased to sj , which is computed based on PT .",

        "input": "The underlying idea of this approach is that, two source phrases that are aligned to the same target phrase trend to be paraphrased. We then define a paraphrase-based feature as : where Sj + n − 1j denotes the consecutive word sequence ( or phrase ) in S , which starts from Sj and ends with Sj + n − 1 , N denotes the maximum n-gram order ( here is 3 ) . CountPP ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) is computed based on the following rules: If Sj+n−1j ∈ Q, then CountPP ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) = 1; Else, if 〈Sj+n−1j , s, score( s;Sj+n−1j  )〉 ∈ PP and Sj+n−1j ’s paraphrase s occurs in Q, then CountPP ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) = score( s;Sj+n−1j  ) Else, CountPP ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) = 0. 4.2.2 Phrase-to-Phrase Translation Similar to hPP ( S,Q ), a phrase translation-based feature based on a phrase table PT is defined as: where CountPT ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) is computed based on the following rules: If Sj+n−1j ∈ Q, then CountPT ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) = 1; Else, if 〈Sj+n−1j , s, p( Sj+n−1j |s ), p( s|Sj+n−1j  )〉 ∈ PT and Sj+n−1j ’s translation s ∈ Q, then CountPT ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) = p( Sj+n−1j |s ) · p( s|Sj+n−1j  ) Else, CountPT ( Sj+n−1j ,Q ) = 0 We train a phrase table based on ‘question-answer’ pairs crawled from community QA websites. 4.3 Sentence-level Feature We first present an attention-based sentence embedding method based on a convolution neural network ( CNN ) , whose input is a sentence pair and output is a sentence embedding pair . Two features will be introduced in Section 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, which are designed based on two sentence embedding models trained using different types of data. In the input layer, given a sentence pair 〈SX ,SY 〉, an attention matrix A ∈ R|SX |×|SY | is generated based on pre-trained word embeddings of SX and SY , where each element Ai,j ∈ A is computed as: where vSXi ( or v SY j  ) denotes the embedding vector of the ith ( or jth ) word in SX ( or SY  ). Then, column-wise and row-wise max-pooling are applied to A to generate two attention vectors V SX ∈ R|SX | and V SY ∈ R|SY |, where the kth elements of V SX and V SY are computed as:  )can be interpreted as the attention score of the kth word in SX ( or SY  ) with regard to all words in SY ( or SX  ). Next, two attention distributions DSX ∈ R|SX | and DSY ∈ R|SY | are generated for SX and SY based on V SX and V SY respectively, where the kth elements of DSX and DSY are computed as: can be interpreted as the normalized attention score of the kth word in SX ( or SY  ) with regard to all words in SY ( or SX  ). Last, we update each pre-trained word embedding vSXk ( or v SY k  ) to vˆ SX k ( or vˆ SY k  ), by multiplying every value in vSXk ( or v SY k  ) with D SX k ( or D SY k  ). The underlying intuition of updating pre-trained word embeddings is to re-weight the importance of each word in SX ( or SY  ) based on SY ( or SX  ), instead of treating them in an equal manner. In the convolution layer, we first derive an input matrix ZSX = {l1, ..., l|SX |}, where lt is the concatenation of a sequence ofm = 2d−14 updated word embeddings [vˆSXt−d, ..., vˆ SX t , ..., vˆ SX t+d], centralized in the tth word in SX .",

        "input": "Then, the convolution layer performs sliding window-based feature extraction to project each vector representation lt ∈ ZSX to a contextual feature vector hSXt : where Wc is the convolution matrix, is the activation function. The same operation is performed to SY as well.

Here, max-pooling is used to force the network to retain the most useful local features by hSXt ( i ) denotes the ith value in the vector h SX t . The same operation are performed to SY as well.

We expect this feature captures the causality relationship between questions and their corresponding answers, and works on question-like utterances. 4.3.2 Discourse Relationship Modeling We train the second attention-based sentence embedding model based on a set of ‘sentence-next sentence’ pairs as input sentence pairs, and then design a discourse relationship-based feature as: ySDR( S ) and ySDR( Q ) denote the sentence embeddings of S and Q respectively.",

        "input": "We expect this feature learns and captures the discourse relationship between sentences and their next sentences, and works on statement-like utterances. Here, a large number of ‘sentence-next sentence’ pairs can be easily obtained from documents. 4.4 Document-level Feature We take document-level information into consideration to measure the semantic similarity between Q and S, and define two context features as: where S∗ can be Sprev and Snext that denote previous and next sentences of S in the original document. The sentence embedding model trained based on ‘question-answer’ pairs ( in Section 4.3.1 ) is directly used to generate context embeddings for hDM ( Sprev,Q ) and hDM ( Snext,Q ). So no further training data is needed for this feature. 4.5 Relation-level Feature Given a structured knowledge base, such as Freebase5, a single relation question Q ( in natural language ) with its answer can be first parsed into a fact formatted as 〈esbj , rel, eobj〉, where esbj denotes a subject entity detected from the question, rel denotes the relationship expressed by the question, eobj denotes an object entity found from the knowledge base based on esbj and rel. Then we can get 〈Q, rel〉 pairs. This rel can help for modeling semantic relationships between Q and R. For example, the Q-A pair 〈What does Jimmy Neutron do? − inventor〉 can be parsed into 〈Jimmy Neutron, fictional character occupation, inventor〉 where the rel is fictional character occupation. Similar to Yih et al . ( 2014 ) , We use 〈 Q , rel 〉 pairs as training data , and learn a rel-CNN model , which can encode each question Q ( or each relation rel ) into a relation embedding . For a given question Q, the corresponding relation rel+ is treated as a positive example, and randomly selected other relations are used as negative examples rel−. The posterior probability of rel + givenQ is computed as : y ( rel ) and y ( Q ) denote relation embeddings of rel and Q based on rel-CNN . rel-CNN is trained by maximizing the log-posterior .",

Thus, we obtain 〈Q, type〉 pairs. Similar to rel-CNN , we use 〈 Q , type 〉 pairs to train another CNN model , denoted as type-CNN . Based on which , we define a type-based feature as : hTE ( S , Q ) = cosine ( yTE ( Q ) , yTE ( S ) ) yTE ( S ) and yTE ( Q ) denote type embeddings of S and Q respectively , coming from type-CNN . 4.7 Topic-level Feature 4.7.1 Unsupervised Topic Model As the assumption that Q-R pair should share similar topic distribution, We define an unsupervised topic model-based feature hUTM as the average cosine distance between topic vectors of all non-stopword pairs 〈vSj , vQi〉, where vw = [p( t1|w ), ..., p( tN |w )]T denotes the topic vector of a given word w. Given a corpus , various topic modeling methods , such as pLSI ( probabilistic latent semantic indexing ) and LDA ( latent Dirichlet allocation ) , can be used to estimate p ( ti | w ) , which denotes the probability thatw belongs to a topic ti . 4.7.2 Supervised Topic Model One shortcoming of the unsupervised topic model is that, the topic size is pre-defined, which might not reflect the truth on a specific corpus. In this paper, we explore a supervised topic model approach as well, based on ‘sentence-topic’ pairs. We crawl a large number of 〈 S , topic 〉 pairs from Wikipedia documents , where S denotes a sentence , topic denotes the content name of the section that S extracted from . Such content names are labeled by Wikipedia article editors , and can be found in the Contents fields . Similar to rel-CNN and type-CNN , we use the 〈 S , topic 〉 pairs to train another CNN model , denoted as topic-CNN . Based on which , we define a supervised topic model-based feature as : ySTM ( S ) and ySTM ( Q ) denote topic embeddings of S andQ respectively , coming from topic-CNN . 4.8 Learning to Ranking Model We employ a regression-based learning to rank method ( Nallapati , 2004 ) to train response ranking model , based on a set of labeled 〈 Q , C 〉 pairs , Feature weights in the ranking model are trained by SGD based on the training data that consists of a set of 〈 Q , C 〉 pairs , where Q denotes a user utterance and C denotes a set of response candidates .",

Response retrieval cannot always guarantee to return a candidate set that contains at least one suitable response, but response ranking will output the best possible candidate all the time. So, we have to decide which responses are confident enough to be output, and which are not. In this paper, we define response triggering as a function that decides whether a response candidate S has enough confidence to be output: where Trigger( Q,S ) returns true, if and only if all its three sub-functions return true. IU ( Q ) returns true, if Q is an informative query. We collect and label chit-chat queries based on conversational exchanges from social media websites to train the classifier. IRank( S,Q ) returns true, if the score s( S,Q ) exceeds an empirical threshold τ : where α is the scaling factor that controls the distribution of s( · ) smooth or sharp. Both α and τ are selected based on a separated development set. IR( S ) returns true, if ( i ) the length of S is less than a pre-defined threshold, and ( ii ) S does not start with a phrase that expresses a progressive relation, such as but also, besides, moreover and etc., as the contents of sentences starting with such phrases usually depend on their context sentences, and they are not suitable for responses. 6 Related Work For modeling dialogue.

Prior work in measuring the relevance between question and answer is mainly in word-level and syntactic-level ( Wang and Manning, 2010; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Yih et al., 2013 ). Learning representation by neural network architecture ( Yu et al., 2014; Wang and Nyberg, 2015; Severyn and Moschitti, 2015 ) has become a hot research topic to go beyond word-level or phrase-level methods.

We check un-triggered queries, and find most of them are chitchat, such as ”hi”, ”hello”, ”who are you? ”. ( 2 ) Better cases are more than worse cases. Most queries in better cases are non-chitchat ones, and their contents are highly related to the domain of their corresponding WeChat official accounts. ( 3 ) Our proposed method is a perfect complement for chitchat engines on informative utterances. The reasons for bad cases are two-fold : First , a DocChat response overlaps with a query , but cannot actually response it . For this issue, we need to refine the capability of our response ranking model on measuring causality relationships. Second , we wrongly send a chitchat query to DocChat , as currently , we only use a white list of chitchat queries for chitchat / non-chitchat classification ( Section 5 ) . 8 Conclusion This paper presents a response retrieval method for chatbot engines based on unstructured documents.

        "input": "Learning Structured Natural Language Representations for Semantic Parsing Abstract We introduce a neural semantic parser which is interpretable and scalable. Our model converts natural language utterances to intermediate, domain-general natural language representations in the form of predicate-argument structures, which are induced with a transition system and subsequently mapped to target domains. The semantic parser is trained end-to-end using annotated logical forms or their denotations. We achieve the state of the art on SPADES and GRAPHQUESTIONS and obtain competitive results on GEO-QUERY and WEBQUESTIONS . The induced predicate-argument structures shed light on the types of representations useful for semantic parsing and how these are different from linguistically motivated ones.1 1 Introduction Semantic parsing is the task of mapping natural language utterances to machine interpretable meaning representations. Despite differences in the choice of meaning representation and model structure, most existing work conceptualizes semantic parsing following two main approaches. Under the first approach, an utterance is parsed and grounded to a meaning representation directly via learning a task-specific grammar ( Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kwiatkowksi et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011; Berant et al., 2013; Flanigan et al., 2014; Pasupat and Liang, 2015; Groschwitz et al., 2015 ). Under the second approach, the utterance is first parsed to an intermediate task-independent representation tied to a syntactic parser and then mapped to a grounded representation ( Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Reddy et al., 2016, 2014; Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2015; Gardner and Krishnamurthy, 2017 ). A merit of the two-stage approach is that it creates reusable intermediate interpretations, which potentially enables the handling of unseen words and knowledge transfer across domains ( Bender et al., 2015 ). The successful application of encoder-decoder models ( Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014 ) to a variety of NLP tasks has provided strong impetus to treat semantic parsing as a sequence transduction problem where an utterance is mapped to a target meaning representation in string format ( Dong and Lapata, 2016; Jia and Liang, 2016; Kocˇisky´ et al., 2016 ).",

        "input": "Such models still fall under the first approach, however, in contrast to previous work ( Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Liang et al., 2011 ) they reduce the need for domain-specific assumptions, grammar learning, and more generally extensive feature engineering. But this modeling flexibility comes at a cost since it is no longer possible to interpret how meaning composition is performed. Such knowledge plays a critical role in understand modeling limitations so as to build better semantic parsers. Moreover, without any taskspecific prior knowledge, the learning problem is fairly unconstrained, both in terms of the possible derivations to consider and in terms of the target output which can be ill-formed ( e.g., with extra or missing brackets ). In this work, we propose a neural semantic parser that alleviates the aforementioned problems. Our model falls under the second class of approaches where utterances are first mapped to an intermediate representation containing natural language predicates. However , rather than using an external parser ( Reddy et al . , 2014 , 2016 ) or manually specified CCG grammars ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 2013 ) , we induce intermediate representations in the form of predicate-argument structures from data . This is achieved with a transition-based approach which by design yields recursive semantic structures , avoiding the problem of generating ill-formed meaning representations . Compared to most existing semantic parsers which employ a CKY style bottom-up parsing strategy ( Krishnamurthy and Mitchell , 2012 ; Cai and Yates , 2013 ; Berant et al . , 2013 ; Berant and Liang , 2014 ) , the transition-based approach we proposed does not require feature decomposition over structures and thereby enables the exploration of rich , non-local features . The output of the transition system is then grounded ( e.g., to a knowledge base ) with a neural mapping model under the assumption that grounded and ungrounded structures are isomorphic.2 As a result, we obtain a neural model that jointly learns to parse natural language semantics and induce a lexicon that helps grounding.",

        "input": "The whole network is trained end-to-end on natural language utterances paired with annotated logical forms or their denotations. We conduct experiments on four datasets , including GEOQUERY ( which has logical forms ; Zelle and Mooney 1996 ) , SPADES ( Bisk et al . , 2016 ) , WEB-QUESTIONS ( Berant et al . , 2013 ) , and GRAPH-QUESTIONS ( Su et al . , 2016 ) ( which have denotations ) . Our semantic parser achieves the state of the art on SPADES and GRAPHQUESTIONS , while obtaining competitive results on GEOQUERY and WEBQUESTIONS . A side-product of our modeling framework is that the induced intermediate representations can contribute to rationalizing neural predictions ( Lei et al., 2016 ). Specifically, they can shed light on the kinds of representations ( especially predicates ) useful for semantic parsing. Evaluation of the induced predicate-argument relations against syntax-based ones reveals that they are interpretable and meaningful compared to heuristic baselines, but they sometimes deviate from linguistic conventions. 2 Preliminaries Problem Formulation Let K denote a knowledge base or more generally a reasoning system, and x an utterance paired with a grounded meaning representationG or its denotation y. Our problem is to learn a semantic parser that maps x to G via an intermediate ungrounded representation U . When G is executed against K, it outputs denotation y. Grounded Meaning Representation. We represent grounded meaning representations in FunQL ( Kate et al . , 2005 ) amongst many other alternatives such as lambda calculus ( Zettlemoyer and Collins , 2005 ) , λ-DCS ( Liang , 2013 ) or graph queries ( Holzschuher and Peinl , 2013 ; Harris et al . , 2013 ) .",

        "input": "FunQL is a variable-free query language , where each predicate is treated as a function symbol that modifies an argument list . For example , the FunQL representation for the utterance which states do not border texas is : where next to is a domain-specific binary predicate that takes one argument ( i.e . , the entity texas ) and returns a set of entities ( e.g . , the states bordering Texas ) as its denotation . all is a special predicate that returns a collection of entities. exclude is a predicate that returns the difference between two input sets. An advantage of FunQL is that the resulting s-expression encodes semantic compositionality and derivation of the logical forms . This property makes FunQL logical forms convenient to be predicted with recurrent neural networks ( Vinyals et al . , 2015 ; Choe and Charniak , 2016 ; Dyer et al . , 2016 ) . However , FunQL is less expressive than lambda calculus , partially due to the elimination of variables . A more compact logical formulation which our method also applies to is λ-DCS ( Liang, 2013 ). In the absence of anaphora and composite binary predicates , conversion algorithms exist between FunQL and λ-DCS . However, we leave this to future work. Ungrounded Meaning Representation.

        "input": "The latter consist primarily of natural language predicates and domain-general predicates. Assuming for simplicity that domaingeneral predicates share the same vocabulary in ungrounded and grounded representations, the ungrounded representation for the example utterance is: answer( exclude( states( all ), border( texas ) ) ) where states and border are natural language predicates. In this work we consider five types of domain-general predicates illustrated in Table 1. Notice that domain-general predicates are often implicit, or represent extra-sentential knowledge. For example, the predicate all in the above utterance represents all states in the domain which are not mentioned in the utterance but are critical for working out the utterance denotation. Finally, note that for certain domain-general predicates, it also makes sense to extract natural language rationales ( e.g., not is indicative for exclude ). But we do not find this helpful in experiments. In this work we constrain ungrounded representations to be structurally isomorphic to grounded ones. In order to derive the target logical forms, all we have to do is replacing predicates in the ungrounded representations with symbols in the knowledge base. 3 Modeling In this section, we discuss our neural model which maps utterances to target logical forms. The semantic parsing task is decomposed in two stages: we first explain how an utterance is converted to an intermediate representation ( Section 3.1 ), and then describe how it is grounded to a knowledge base ( Section 3.2 ). 3.1 Generating Ungrounded Representations At this stage , utterances are mapped to intermediate representations with a transition-based algorithm .",

        "input": "In general, the transition system generates the representation by following a derivation tree ( which contains a set of applied rules ) and some canonical generation order ( e.g., depth-first ). For FunQL , a simple solution exists since the representation itself encodes the derivation . Consider again answer( exclude( states( all ), border( texas ) ) ) which is tree structured. Each predicate ( e.g., border ) can be visualized as a non-terminal node of the tree and each entity ( e.g., texas ) as a terminal. The predicate all is a special case which acts as a terminal directly. We can generate the tree with a top-down , depth first transition system reminiscent of recurrent neural network grammars ( RNNGs ; Dyer et al . 2016 ) . Similar to RNNG , our algorithm uses a buffer to store input tokens in the utterance and a stack to store partially completed trees . A major difference in our semantic parsing scenario is that tokens in the buffer are not fetched in a sequential order or removed from the buffer. This is because the lexical alignment between an utterance and its semantic representation is hidden. Moreover, some predicates cannot be clearly anchored to a token span.",

        "input": "Therefore, we allow the generation algorithm to pick tokens and combine logical forms in arbitrary orders, conditioning on the entire set of sentential features. Alternative solutions in the traditional semantic parsing literature include a floating chart parser ( Pasupat and Liang, 2015 ) which allows to construct logical predicates out of thin air. Our transition system defines three actions, namely NT, TER, and RED, explained below. NT( X ) generates a Non-Terminal predicate. This predicate is either a natural language expression such as border, or one of the domain-general predicates exemplified in Table 1 ( e.g., exclude ). The type of predicate is determined by the placeholder X and once generated, it is pushed onto the stack and represented as a non-terminal followed by an open bracket ( e.g., ‘border( ’ ). The open bracket will be closed by a reduce operation. TER( X ) generates a TERminal entity or the special predicate all. Note that the terminal choice does not include variable ( e.g . , $0 , $1 ) , since FunQL is a variable-free language which sufficiently captures the semantics of the datasets we work with . The framework could be extended to generate directly acyclic graphs by incorporating variables with additional transition actions for handling variable mentions and co-reference.",

        "input": "RED stands for REDuce and is used for subtree completion. It recursively pops elements from the stack until an open non-terminal node is encountered. The non-terminal is popped as well, after which a composite term representing the entire subtree, e.g., border( texas ), is pushed back to the stack. If a RED action results in having no more open non-terminals left on the stack, the transition system terminates. Table 2 shows the transition actions used to generate our running example. The model generates the ungrounded representation U conditioned on utterance x by recursively calling one of the above three actions. Note that U is defined by a sequence of actions ( denoted by a ) and a sequence of term choices ( denoted by u ) as shown in Table 2. The conditional probability p( U |x ) is factorized over time steps as: where I is an indicator function. To predict the actions of the transition system , we encode the input buffer with a bidirectional LSTM ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) and the output stack with a stack-LSTM ( Dyer et al . , 2015 ) .

        "input": "While the stack representation st is easy to retrieve as the top state of the stack-LSTM , obtaining the buffer representation bt is more involved . This is because we do not have an explicit buffer representation due to the non-projectivity of semantic parsing. We therefore compute at each time step an adaptively weighted representation of bt ( Bahdanau et al., 2015 ) conditioned on the stack representation st. This buffer representation is then concatenated with the stack representation to form the system representation et. When the predicted action is either NT or TER, an ungrounded term ut ( either a predicate or an entity ) needs to be chosen from the candidate list depending on the specific placeholder X. To select a domain-general term, we use the same representation of the transition system et to compute a probability distribution over candidate terms. To choose a natural language term, we directly compute a probability distribution of all natural language terms ( in the buffer ) conditioned on the stack representation st and select the most relevant term ( Jia and Liang, 2016 ). When the predicted action is RED, the completed subtree is composed into a single representation on the stack. For the choice of composition function, we use a single-layer neural network as in Dyer et al. ( 2015 ), which takes as input the concatenated representation of the predicate and argument of the subtree. 3.2 Generating Grounded Representations Since we constrain the network to learn ungrounded structures that are isomorphic to the target meaning representation, converting ungrounded representations to grounded ones becomes a simple lexical mapping problem.

The above grounding step can be interpreted as learning a lexicon: the model exclusively relies on the intermediate representation U to predict the target meaning representation G without taking into account any additional features based on the utterance. In practice , U may provide sufficient contextual background for closed domain semantic parsing where an ungrounded predicate often maps to a single grounded predicate , but is a relatively impoverished representation for parsing large open-domain knowledge bases like Freebase . In this case, we additionally rely on a discriminative reranker which ranks the grounded representations derived from ungrounded representations ( see Section 3.4 ). 3.3 Training Objective When the target meaning representation is available, we directly compare it against our predictions and back-propagate. When only denotations are available, we compare surrogate meaning representations against our predictions ( Reddy et al., 2014 ). Surrogate representations are those with the correct denotations. When there exist multi-ple surrogate representations,3 we select one randomly and back-propagate. The global effect of the above update rule is close to maximizing the marginal likelihood of denotations, which differs from recent work on weakly-supervised semantic parsing based on reinforcement learning ( Neelakantan et al., 2017 ).

We aim to maximize the likelihood of the grounded meaning representation p( G|x ) over all training examples. This likelihood can be decomposed into the likelihood of the grounded action sequence p( a|x ) and the grounded term sequence p( g|x ), which we optimize separately. For the grounded action sequence ( which by design is the same as the ungrounded action sequence and therefore the output of the transition system ), we can directly maximize the log likelihood log p( a|x ) for all examples: where T denotes examples in the training data. For the grounded term sequence g, since the intermediate ungrounded terms are latent, we maximize the expected log likelihood of the grounded terms ∑ u [p( u|x ) log p( g|u, x )] for all examples, which is a lower bound of the log likelihood log p( g|x ). The final objective is the combination of La and Lg, denoted as LG = La + Lg. We optimize this objective with the method described in Lei et al.

For the other three datasets, we treat surrogate meaning representations which lead to the correct answer as gold standard. The surrogates were selected from a subset of candidate Freebase graphs, which were obtained by entity linking. Entity mentions in SPADES have been automatically annotated with Freebase entities ( Gabrilovich et al . , 2013 ) . For WEBQUESTIONS and GRAPHQUESTIONS , we follow the procedure described in Reddy et al . ( 2016 ) . We identify potential entity spans using seven handcrafted part-of-speech patterns and associate them with Freebase entities obtained from the Freebase / KG API . We use a structured perceptron trained on the entities found in WEBQUESTIONS and GRAPHQUES-TIONS to select the top 10 non-overlapping entity disambiguation possibilities .",

Table 8 also shows the breakdown of matching scores per linguistic construction, with the number of utterances in each type. In Table 9 , we provide examples of predicates identified by SCANNER , indicating whether they agree or not with the output of EASYCCG . As a reminder , the task in SPADES is to predict the entity masked by a blank symbol ( ) . As can be seen in Table 8, the matching score is relatively high for utterances involving coordination and prepositional phrase attachments. The model will often identify informative predicates ( e.g., nouns ) which do not necessarily agree with linguistic intuition. For example , in the utterance wilhelm maybach and his son started maybach in 1909 ( see Table 9 ) , SCANNER identifies the predicateargument structure son ( wilhelm maybach ) rather than started ( wilhelm maybach ) . We also observed that the model struggles with control and subordinate constructions.

Our model essentially jointly learns how to parse natural language semantics and the lexicons that help grounding. Compared to previous neural semantic parsers, our model is more interpretable as the intermediate structures are useful for inspecting what the model has learned and whether it matches linguistic intuition. An assumption our model imposes is that ungrounded and grounded representations are structurally isomorphic. An advantage of this assumption is that tokens in the ungrounded and grounded representations are strictly aligned. This allows the neural network to focus on parsing and lexical mapping, sidestepping the challenging structure mapping problem which would result in a larger search space and higher variance. On the negative side, the structural isomorphism assumption restricts the expressiveness of the model, especially since one of the main benefits of adopting a two-stage parser is the potential of capturing domain-independent semantic information via the intermediate representation. While it would be challenging to handle drastically non-isomorphic structures in the current model, it is possible to perform local structure matching, i.e., when the mapping between natural language and domainspecific predicates is many-to-one or one-to-many. For instance , Freebase does not contain a relation representing daughter , using instead two relations representing female and child . Previous work ( Kwiatkowski et al., 2013 ) models such cases by introducing collapsing ( for many-to-one mapping ) and expansion ( for one-to-many mapping ) operators.",

        "input": "Morph-fitting: Fine-Tuning Word Vector Spaces with Simple Language-Specific Rules Abstract Morphologically rich languages accentuate two properties of distributional vector space models : 1 ) the difficulty of inducing accurate representations for low-frequency word forms ; and 2 ) insensitivity to distinct lexical relations that have similar distributional signatures . These effects are detrimental for language understanding systems, which may infer that inexpensive is a rephrasing for expensive or may not associate acquire with acquires. In this work, we propose a novel morph-fitting procedure which moves past the use of curated semantic lexicons for improving distributional vector spaces. Instead, our method injects morphological constraints generated using simple language-specific rules, pulling inflectional forms of the same word close together and pushing derivational antonyms far apart. In intrinsic evaluation over four languages, we show that our approach: 1 ) improves low-frequency word estimates; and 2 ) boosts the semantic quality of the entire word vector collection. Finally, we show that morph-fitted vectors yield large gains in the downstream task of dialogue state tracking, highlighting the importance of morphology for tackling long-tail phenomena in language understanding tasks. 1 Introduction Word representation learning has become a research area of central importance in natural language processing ( NLP ), with its usefulness demonstrated across many application areas such as parsing ( Chen and Manning, 2014; Johannsen et al., 2015 ), machine translation ( Zou et al., 2013 ), and many others ( Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011 ). Most prominent word representation techniques are grounded in the distributional hypothesis ( Harris, 1954 ), relying on word co-occurrence information in large textual corpora ( Curran, 2004; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013; Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Schwartz et al., 2015, i.a. ). Morphologically rich languages, in which “substantial grammatical information. . . is expressed at word level” ( Tsarfaty et al., 2010 ), pose specific challenges for NLP. This is not always considered when techniques are evaluated on languages such as English or Chinese, which do not have rich morphology. In the case of distributional vector space models , morphological complexity brings two challenges to the fore : Estimating Rare Words: A single lemma can have many different surface realisations.",

        "input": "Naively treating each realisation as a separate word leads to sparsity problems and a failure to exploit their shared semantics. On the other hand, lemmatising the entire corpus can obfuscate the differences that exist between different word forms even though they share some aspects of meaning. Embedded Semantics: Morphology can encode semantic relations such as antonymy ( e.g. literate and illiterate, expensive and inexpensive ) or ( near- )synonymy ( north, northern, northerly ). In this work, we tackle the two challenges jointly by introducing a resource-light vector space finetuning procedure termed morph-fitting. The proposed method does not require curated knowledge bases or gold lexicons. Instead, it makes use of the observation that morphology implicitly encodes semantic signals pertaining to synonymy ( e.g., German word inflections katalanisch, katalanischem, katalanischer denote the same semantic concept in different grammatical roles ), and antonymy ( e.g., mature vs. immature ), capitalising on the proliferation of word forms in morphologically rich languages. Formalised as an instance of the post-processing semantic specialisation paradigm ( Faruqui et al., 2015; Mrkšic´ et al., 2016 ), morphfitting is steered by a set of linguistic constraints derived from simple language-specific rules which describe ( a subset of ) morphological processes in a language. The constraints emphasise similarity on one side ( e.g., by extracting morphological synonyms ), and antonymy on the other ( by extracting morphological antonyms ), see Fig. 1 and Tab. 2. The key idea of the fine-tuning process is to pull synonymous examples described by the constraints closer together in the transformed vector space, while at the same time pushing antonymous examples away from each other. The explicit post-hoc injection of morphological constraints enables: a ) the estimation of more accurate vectors for low-frequency words which are linked to their high-frequency forms by the constructed constraints;1 this tackles the data sparsity problem; and b ) specialising the distributional space to distinguish between similarity and relatedness ( Kiela et al., 2015 ), thus supporting language understanding applications such as dialogue state tracking ( DST ).2 As a post-processor, morph-fitting allows the integration of morphological rules with any distributional vector space in any language: it treats an input distributional word vector space as a black box and fine-tunes it so that the transformed space reflects the knowledge coded in the input morphological constraints ( e.g., Italian words rispettoso and irrispetosa should be far apart in the transformed vector space, see Fig. 1 ).",

        "input": "Tab. 1 illustrates the effects of morph-fitting by qualitative examples in three languages: the vast majority of nearest neighbours are “morphological” synonyms. We demonstrate the efficacy of morph-fitting in four languages ( English, German, Italian, Russian ), yielding large and consistent improvements on benchmarking word similarity evaluation sets such as SimLex-999 ( Hill et al., 2015 ), its multilingual extension ( Leviant and Reichart, 2015 ), and SimVerb-3500 ( Gerz et al., 2016 ). The improvements are reported for all four languages, and with a variety of input distributional spaces, verifying the robustness of the approach. We then show that incorporating morph-fitted vectors into a state-of-the-art neural-network DST model results in improved tracking performance , especially for morphologically rich languages . We report an improvement of 4% on Italian, and 6% on German when using morph-fitted vectors instead of the distributional ones, setting a new state-of-the-art DST performance for the two datasets.3 2 Morph-fitting: Methodology Preliminaries. In this work, we focus on four languages with varying levels of morphological complexity: English ( EN ), German ( DE ), Italian ( IT ), and Russian ( RU ). These correspond to languages in the Multilingual SimLex - 999 dataset . Vocabularies Wen , Wde , Wit , Wru are compiled by retaining all word forms from the four Wikipedias with word frequency over 10 , see Tab . 3 . We then extract sets of linguistic constraints from these ( large ) vocabularies using a set of simple language-specific if-then-else rules, see Tab. 2.4 These constraints ( Sect . 2.2 ) are used as input for the vector space post-processing ATTRACT-REPEL algorithm ( outlined in Sect . 2.1 ) . 2.1 The ATTRACT-REPEL Model The ATTRACT-REPEL model , proposed by Mrkšic ´ et al . ( 2017b ) , is an extension of the PARAGRAM procedure proposed by Wieting et al . ( 2015 ) .

        "input": "Given the initial vector space and collections of ATTRACT and REPEL constraints A and R, the model gradually modifies the space to bring the designated word vectors closer together or further apart. The method’s cost function consists of three terms. The first term pulls the ATTRACT examples ( xl, xr ) ∈ A closer together. If BA denotes the current mini-batch of ATTRACT examples, this term can be expressed as: where δatt is the similarity margin which determines how much closer synonymous vectors should be to each other than to each of their respective negative examples. ReLU( x ) = max( 0, x ) is the standard rectified linear unit ( Nair and Hinton, 2010 ). The ‘negative’ example ti for each word xi in any ATTRACT pair is the word vector closest to xi among the examples in the current minibatch ( distinct from its target synonym and xi itself ). This means that this term forces synonymous words from the in-batch ATTRACT constraints to be closer to one another than to any other word in the current mini-batch. The second term pushes antonyms away from each other. If ( xl, xr ) ∈ BR is the current minibatch of REPEL constraints, this term can be expressed as follows. In this case, each word’s ‘negative’ example is the ( in-batch ) word vector furthest away from it ( and distinct from the word’s target antonym ).",

        "input": "The intuition is that we want antonymous words from the input REPEL constraints to be further away from each other than from any other word in the current mini-batch; δrpl is now the repel margin. The final term of the cost function serves to retain the abundance of semantic information encoded in the starting distributional space. If xiniti is the initial distributional vector and V ( B ) is the set of all vectors present in the given mini-batch, this term ( per mini-batch ) is expressed as follows where λreg is the L2 regularisation constant.5 This term effectively pulls word vectors towards their initial ( distributional ) values, ensuring that relations encoded in initial vectors persist as long as they do not contradict the newly injected ones. 2.2 Language-Specific Rules and Constraints Semantic Specialisation with Constraints The fine-tuning ATTRACT-REPEL procedure is entirely driven by the input ATTRACT and REPEL sets of constraints. These can be extracted from a variety of semantic databases such as WordNet ( Fellbaum , 1998 ) , the Paraphrase Database ( Ganitkevitch et al . , 2013 ; Pavlick et al . , 2015 ) , or BabelNet ( Navigli and Ponzetto , 2012 ; Ehrmann et al . , 2014 ) as done in prior work ( Faruqui et al . , 2015 ; Wieting et al . , 2015 ; Mrkšic ´ et al . , 2016 , i.a . ) . In this work, we investigate another option: extracting constraints without curated knowledge bases in a spectrum of languages by exploiting inherent language-specific properties related to linguistic morphology. This relaxation ensures a wider portability of ATTRACT-REPEL to languages and domains without readily available or adequate resources . Extracting ATTRACT Pairs. The core difference between inflectional and derivational morphology can be summarised in a few lines as follows: the former refers to a set of processes through which the word form expresses meaningful syntactic information, e.g., verb tense, without any change to the semantics of the word. On the other hand, the latter refers to the formation of new words with semantic shifts in meaning ( Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Haspelmath and Sims, 2013; Lazaridou et al., 2013; Zeller et al., 2013; Cotterell and Schütze, 2017 ). For the ATTRACT constraints, we focus on inflectional rather than on derivational morphology rules as the former preserve the full meaning of a word, modifying it only to reflect grammatical roles such as verb tense or case markers ( e.g., ( en_read, en_reads ) or ( de_katalanisch, de_katalanischer ) ).",

We define two rules for English, widely recognised as morphologically simple ( Avramidis and Koehn, 2008; Cotterell et al., 2016b ). These are: ( R1 ) if w1, w2 ∈Wen, where w2 = w1 + ing/ed/s, then add ( w1, w2 ) and ( w2, w1 ) to the set of AT-TRACT constraints A. This rule yields pairs such as ( look, looks ), ( look, looking ), ( look, looked ). If w[: −1] is a function which strips the last character from word w, the second rule is: ( R2 ) if w1 ends with the letter e and w1 ∈ Wen and w2 ∈ Wen, where w2 = w1[: −1] + ing/ed, then add ( w1, w2 ) and ( w2, w1 ) to A. This creates pairs such as ( create, creating ) and ( create, created ). Naturally, introducing more sophisticated rules is possible in order to cover for other special cases and morphological irregularities ( e.g., sweep / swept ), but in all our EN experiments, A is based on the two simple EN rules R1 and R2. The other three languages, with more complicated morphology, yield a larger number of rules. In Italian, we rely on the sets of rules spanning: ( 1 ) regular formation of plural ( libro / libri ); ( 2 ) regular verb conjugation ( aspettare / aspettiamo ); ( 3 ) regular formation of past participle ( aspettare / aspettato ); and ( 4 ) rules regarding grammatical gender ( bianco / bianca ). Besides these, another set of rules is used for German and Russian: ( 5 ) regular declension ( e.g., asiatisch / asiatischem ).",

Following the same principle, we use APde = {un, nicht, anti, ir, in, miss}, APit = {in, ir, im, anti}, and APru = {не, анти}. For instance, this generates an IT pair ( rispettoso, irrispettoso ) ( see Fig. 1 ). For DE, we use another rule targeting suffix replacement: -voll is replaced by -los.

A baseline which utilises an equal amount of knowledge as morph-fitting, termed morph-fixing, fixes the vector of each word to the distributional vector of its most frequent inflectional synonym, tying the vectors of low-frequency words to their more frequent inflections. For each word w1, we construct a set of M + 1 words Ww1 = {w1, w′1, . . . , w′M} consisting of the word w1 itself and all M words which cooccur with w1 in the ATTRACT constraints.

Morphfitted vectors bring consistent improvement across all experiments, regardless of the quality of the initial distributional space. This finding confirms that the method is robust: its effectiveness does not depend on the architecture used to construct the initial space. To illustrate the improvements , note that the best score on SimVerb for a model trained on running text is achieved by Context2vec ( ρ = 0.388 ) ; injecting morphological constraints into this vector space results in a gain of 7.1 ρ points .

The results are summarised in Tab. 5, while Fig. 3a-3d show results for the morph-fitted SGNS-LARGE vectors. These scores confirm the effectiveness and robustness of morph-fitting across languages, suggesting that the idea of fitting to morphological constraints is indeed language-agnostic, given the set of language-specific rule-based constraints.

Besides their lower performance, the two other specialisation models have additional disadvantages compared to the proposed morph-fitting model. First, retrofitting is able to incorporate only synonymy/ATTRACT pairs, while our results demonstrate the usefulness of both types of constraints, both for intrinsic evaluation ( Tab. 5 ) and downstream tasks ( see later Fig. 3 ). Second, counter-fitting is computationally intractable with SGNS-LARGE vectors, as its regularisation term involves the computation of all pairwise distances between words in the vocabulary. Further Discussion. The simplicity of the used language-specific rules does come at a cost of occasionally generating incorrect linguistic constraints such as ( tent, intent ), ( prove, improve ) or ( press, impress ). In future work, we will study how to further refine extracted sets of constraints. We also plan to conduct experiments with gold standard morphological lexicons on languages for which such resources exist ( Sylak-Glassman et al., 2015; Cotterell et al., 2016b ), and investigate approaches which learn morphological inflections and derivations in different languages automatically as another potential source of morphological constraints ( Soricut and Och, 2015; Cotterell et al., 2016a; Faruqui et al., 2016; Kann et al., 2017; Aharoni and Goldberg, 2017, i.a. ). 5 Downstream Task: Dialogue State Tracking ( DST ) Goal-oriented dialogue systems provide conversational interfaces for tasks such as booking flights or finding restaurants.

It is used by the downstream dialogue manager component to choose the subsequent system response ( Su et al., 2016 ).

IT and DE benefit from both kinds of morph-fitting: IT performance increases from 74.1→ 78.1 ( MFIT-A ) and DE performance rises even more: 60.6→ 66.3 ( MFIT-AR ), setting a new state-of-the-art score for both datasets. The morph-fixed vectors do not enhance DST performance, probably because fixing word vectors to their highest frequency inflectional form eliminates useful semantic content encoded in the original vectors. On the other hand, morph-fitting makes use of this information, supplementing it with semantic relations between different morphological forms. These conclusions are in line with the Sim-Lex gains, where morph-fitting outperforms both distributional and morph-fixed vectors. English performance shows little variation across the four word vector collections investigated here. This corroborates our intuition that, as a morphologically simpler language, English stands to gain less from fine-tuning the morphological variation for downstream applications. This result again points at the discrepancy between intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation : the considerable gains in Sim-Lex performance do not necessarily induce similar gains in downstream performance .

Regardless, its performance does correlate with downstream performance to a large extent, providing a useful indicator for the usefulness of specific word vector spaces for extrinsic tasks such as DST. 6 Related Work Semantic Specialisation A standard approach to incorporating external information into vector spaces is to pull the representations of similar words closer together. Some models integrate such constraints into the training procedure, modifying the prior or the regularisation ( Yu and Dredze, 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Bian et al., 2014; Kiela et al., 2015 ), or using a variant of the SGNS-style objective ( Liu et al., 2015; Osborne et al., 2016 ). Another class of models, popularly termed retrofitting, injects lexical knowledge from available semantic databases ( e.g., WordNet, PPDB ) into pre-trained word vectors ( Faruqui et al., 2015; Jauhar et al., 2015; Wieting et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016; Mrkšic´ et al., 2016 ). Morph-fitting falls into the latter category. However, instead of resorting to curated knowledge bases, and experimenting solely with English, we show that the morphological richness of any language can be exploited as a source of inexpensive supervision for fine-tuning vector spaces, at the same time specialising them to better reflect true semantic similarity, and learning more accurate representations for low-frequency words.

Another class of models, operating at the character level, shares a similar methodology: such models compose token-level representations from subcomponent embeddings ( subwords, morphemes, or characters ) ( dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014; Ling et al., 2015; Cao and Rei, 2016; Kim et al., 2016; Wieting et al., 2016; Verwimp et al., 2017, i.a. ). In contrast to prior work, our model decouples the use of morphological information, now provided in the form of inflectional and derivational rules transformed into constraints, from the actual training. This pipelined approach results in a simpler, more portable model. In spirit , our work is similar to Cotterell et al . ( 2016b ) , who formulate the idea of post-training specialisation in a generative Bayesian framework . Their work uses gold morphological lexicons; we show that competitive performance can be achieved using a non-exhaustive set of simple rules. Our framework facilitates the inclusion of antonyms at no extra cost and naturally extends to constraints from other sources ( e.g . , WordNet ) in future work . Another practical difference is that we focus on similarity and evaluate morph-fitting in a well-defined downstream task where the artefacts of the distributional hypothesis are known to prompt statistical system failures. 7 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a novel morph-fitting method which injects morphological knowledge in the form of linguistic constraints into word vector spaces.",

        "input": "Deep Learning in Semantic Kernel Spaces Abstract Kernel methods enable the direct usage of structured representations of textual data during language learning and inference tasks. Expressive kernels, such as Tree Kernels, achieve excellent performance in NLP. On the other side, deep neural networks have been demonstrated effective in automatically learning feature representations during training. However, their input is tensor data, i.e., they cannot manage rich structured information. In this paper, we show that expressive kernels and deep neural networks can be combined in a common framework in order to ( i ) explicitly model structured information and ( ii ) learn non-linear decision functions. We show that the input layer of a deep architecture can be pre-trained through the application of the Nystro¨m low-rank approximation of kernel spaces. The resulting “ kernelized ” neural network achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in three different tasks . 1 Introduction Learning for Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) requires to more or less explicitly account for trees or graphs to express syntactic and semantic information. A straightforward modeling of such information has been obtained in statistical language learning with Tree Kernels ( TKs ) ( Collins and Duffy, 2001 ), or by means of structured neural models ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Socher et al., 2013 ). In particular, kernel-based methods ( Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004 ) have been largely applied in language processing for alleviating the need of complex activities of manual feature engineering ( e.g., ( Moschitti et al., 2008 ) ). Although ad-hoc features are adopted by many successful approaches to language learning ( e.g., ( Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002 ) ), kernels provide a natural way to capture textual generalizations directly operating over ( possibly complex ) linguistic structures.",

        "input": "Sequence ( Cancedda et al., 2003 ) or tree kernels ( Collins and Duffy, 2001 ) are of particular interest as the feature space they implicitly generate reflects linguistic patterns. On the other hand , Recursive Neural Networks ( Socher et al . , 2013 ) have been shown to learn dense feature representations of the nodes in a structure , thus exploiting similarities between nodes and sub-trees . Also , Long-Short Term Memory ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) networks build intermediate representations of sequences , resulting in similarity estimates over sequences and their inner sub-sequences . While such methods are highly effective and reach state-of-the-art results in many tasks, their adoption can be problematic. In kernel-based Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) the classification model corresponds to the set of support vectors ( SVs ) and weights justifying the maximal margin hyperplane : the classification cost crucially depends on their number , as classifying a new instance requires a kernel computation against all SVs , making their adoption in large data settings prohibitive . This scalability issue is evident in many NLP and Information Retrieval applications, such as in answer re-ranking in question answering ( Severyn et al., 2013; Filice et al., 2016 ), where the number of SVs is typically very large. Improving the efficiency of kernel-based methods is a largely studied topic. The reduction of computational costs has been early designed by imposing a budget ( Dekel and Singer, 2006; Wang and Vucetic, 2010 ), that is limiting the maximum number of SVs in a model. However , in complex tasks , such methods still require large budgets to reach adequate accuracies . On the other hand, training complex neural networks is also difficult as no common design practice is established against complex data structures.",

        "input": "In Levy et al. ( 2015 ), a careful analysis of neural word embedding models is carried out and the role of the hyper-parameter estimation is outlined. Different neural architectures result in the same performances, whenever optimal hyper-parameter tuning is applied. In this latter case, no significant difference is observed across different architectures, making the choice between different neural architectures a complex and empirical task. A general approach to the large scale modeling of complex structures is a critical and open problem. A viable and general solution to this scalability issue is provided by the Nystro ¨ m method ( Williams and Seeger , 2001 ) ; it allows to approximate the Gram matrix of a kernel function and support the embedding of future input examples into a low-dimensional space . For example , if used over TKs , the Nystro ¨ m projection corresponds to the embedding of any tree into a low-dimensional vector . In this paper , we show that the Nystro ¨ m based low-rank embedding of input examples can be used as the early layer of a deep feed-forward neural network . A standard NN back-propagation training can thus be applied to induce non-linear functions in the kernel space. The resulting deep architecture , called Kernel-based Deep Architecture ( KDA ) , is a mathematically justified integration of expressive kernel functions and deep neural architectures , with several advantages : it ( i ) directly operates over complex non-tensor structures , e.g . , trees , without any manual feature or architectural engineering , ( ii ) achieves a drastic reduction of the computational cost w.r.t . pure kernel methods , and ( iii ) exploits the non-linearity of NNs to produce accurate models .

Experimental evaluations are described in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 derives the conclusions. 2 Kernel-based Semantic Inference In almost all NLP tasks, explicit models of complex syntactic and semantic structures are required, such as in Paraphrase Detection: deciding whether two sentences are valid paraphrases involves learning grammatical rewriting rules, such as semantics preserving mappings among subtrees. Also in Question Answering, the syntactic information about input questions is crucial. While manual feature engineering is always possible, kernel methods on structured representations of data objects, e.g., sentences, have been largely applied. Since Collins and Duffy ( 2001 ), sentences can be modeled through their corresponding parse tree, and Tree Kernels ( TKs ) result in similarity metrics directly operating over tree fragments. Such kernels corresponds to dot products in the ( implicit ) feature space made of all possible tree fragments ( Haussler, 1999 ). Notice that the number of tree fragments in a tree bank is combinatorial with the number of tree nodes and gives rise to billions of features, i.e., dimensions. In this high-dimensional space , kernel-based algorithms , such as SVMs , can implicitly learn robust prediction models ( Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini , 2004 ) , resulting in state-of-the-art approaches in several NLP tasks , e.g . , Semantic Role Labeling ( Moschitti et al . , 2008 ) , Question Classification ( Croce et al . , 2011 ) or Paraphrase Identification ( Filice et al . , 2015 ) .",

        "input": "As the feature space generated by the structural kernels depends on the input structures, different tree representations can be adopted to reflect more or less expressive syntactic/semantic feature spaces. While constituency parse trees have been early used ( e.g., ( Collins and Duffy, 2001 ) ), dependency parse trees correspond to graph structures. TKs usually rely on their tree conversions, where grammatical edge labels corresponds to nodes. An expressive tree representation of dependency graphs is the Grammatical Relation Centered Tree ( GRCT ). As illustrated in Figure 1, PoS-Tags and grammatical functions correspond to nodes, dominating their associated lexicals. Types of tree kernels. While a variety of TK functions have been studied, e.g., the Partial Tree Kernel ( PTK ) ( Moschitti, 2006 ), the kernels used in this work model grammatical and semantic information, as triggered respectively by the dependency edge labels and lexical nodes. The latter is exploited through recent results in distributional models of lexical semantics, as proposed in word embedding methods ( e.g., ( Mikolov et al., 2013; Sahlgren, 2006 ). In particular, we adopt the Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel ( SPTK ) described in Croce et al. ( 2011 ): it extends the PTK formulation with a similarity function between lexical nodes in a GRCT, i.e., the cosine similarity between word vector representations based on word embeddings.

        "input": "In CSPTK, the lexical information provided by the sentence words is propagated along the non-terminal nodes representing head-modifier dependencies. Figure 2 shows a compositionally-labeled tree, where the similarity function at the nodes can model lexical composition, i.e., capturing contextual information. For example, in the sentence, “What instrument does Hendrix play?”, the role of the word instrument can be fully captured only if its composition with the verb play is considered. The CSPTK applies a composition function between nodes: while several algebraic functions can be adopted to compose two word vectors representing a head/modifier pair, here we refer to a simple additive function that assigns to each ( h,m ) pair the linear combination of the involved vectors, i.e., ( h,m ) = Ah +Bm: although simple and efficient, it actually produces very effective CSPTK functions. Complexity. The training phase of an optimal maximum margin algorithm ( such as SVM ) requires a number of kernel operations that is more than linear ( almost O ( n2 ) ) with respect to the number of training examples n , as discussed in Chang and Lin ( 2011 ) . Also the classification phase depends on the size of the input dataset and the intrinsic complexity of the targeted task: classifying a new instance requires to evaluate the kernel function with respect to each support vector. For complex tasks, the number of selected support vectors tends to be very large, and using the resulting model can be impractical. This cost is also problematic as single kernel operations can be very expensive: the cost of evaluating the PTK on a single tree pair is almost linear in the number of nodes in the input trees, as shown in Moschitti ( 2006 ). When lexical semantics is considered, as in SPTKs and CSPTKs, it is more than linear in the number of nodes ( Croce et al., 2011 ). 3 Deep Learning in Kernel Spaces 3.1 The Nystro¨m method Given an input training dataset D, a kernel K( oi, oj ) is a similarity function over D2 that corresponds to a dot product in the implicit kernel space, i.e., K( oi, oj ) = Φ( oi ) · Φ( oj ).",

Kernel functions are used by learning algorithms , such as SVM , to operate only implicitly on instances in the kernel space , by never accessing their explicit definition . Let us apply the projection function Φ over all examples from D to derive representations, x denoting the rows of the matrix X .

This is obtained by generating an approximation G˜ of G using a subset of l columns of the matrix, i.e., a selection of a subset L ⊂ D of the available examples, called landmarks. Suppose we randomly sample l columns of G, and let C ∈ R|D|×l be the matrix of these sampled columns. Then, we can rearrange the columns and rows of G and define X = [X1 X2] such that: where W = X>1 X1, i.e., the subset of G that contains only landmarks.

Given an input example o ∈ D, a new low-dimensional representation x˜ can be thus determined by considering the corresponding item of C as where c is the vector whose dimensions contain the evaluations of the kernel function between o and each landmark oj ∈ L. Therefore, the method produces l-dimensional vectors. If k is the average number of basic operations required during a single kernel computation, the overall cost of a single projection is O( kl + l2 ), where the first term corresponds to the cost of generating the vector c, while the second term is needed for the matrix multiplications in Equation 4. Typically, the number of landmarks l ranges from hundreds to few thousands and, for complex kernels ( such as Tree Kernels ), the projection cost can be reduced to O( kl ). Several policies have been defined to determine the best selection of landmarks to reduce the Gram Matrix approximation error. In this work the uniform sampling without replacement is adopted, as suggested by Kumar et al.

We focused on the subtask A: given a question and a large collection of questioncomment threads created by a user community, the task consists in ( re- )ranking the comments w.r.t. their utility in answering the question. Subtask A can be modeled as a binary classification problem, where instances are ( question, comment ) pairs. Each pair generates an example for a binary SVM , where the positive label is associated to a good comment and the negative label refers to potentially useful and bad comments . The classification score achieved over different ( question, comment ) pairs is used to sort instances and produce the final ranking over comments. The above setting results in a train and test dataset made of 20,340 and 3,270 examples, respectively. In Filice et al . ( 2016 ) , a Kernel-based SVM classifier ( KSVM ) achieved state-of-the-art results by adopting a kernel combination that exploited ( i ) feature vectors containing linguistic similarities between the texts in a pair ; ( ii ) shallow syntactic trees that encode the lexical and morpho-syntactic information shared between text pairs ; ( iii ) feature vectors capturing task-specific information . Such model includes 11,322 support vectors.

Also on the cQA task , the F1 obtained by the SVMDCD is significantly lower than the KDA one . Moreover , with 800 landmarks KDA achieves the remarkable results of 0.68 of F1 , that is the state-of-the-art against other convolutional systems , e.g . , ConvKN ( Barro ´ n-Ceden ˜ o et al . , 2016 ) : this latter combines convolutional tree kernels with kernels operating on sentence embeddings generated by a convolutional neural network . 4.3 Argument Boundary Detection Semantic Role Labeling ( SRL ) consists of the detection of the semantic arguments associated with the predicate of a sentence ( called Lexical Unit ) and their classification into their specific roles ( Fillmore, 1985 ). For example, given the sentence “Bootleggers then copy the film onto hundreds of tapes” the task would be to recognize the verb copy as representing the DUPLICA-TION frame with roles, CREATOR for Bootleggers, ORIGINAL for the film and GOAL for hundreds of tapes. Argument Boundary Detection ( ABD ) corresponds to the SRL subtask of detecting the sentence fragments spanning individual roles. In the previous example the phrase “the film” represents a role ( i.e., ORIGINAL ), while “of tapes” or “film onto hundreds” do not, as they just partially cover one or multiple roles, respectively. The ABD task has been successfully tackled using TKs since Moschitti et al. ( 2008 ). It can be modeled as a binary classification task over each parse tree node n, where the argument span reflects words covered by the sub-tree rooted at n.

Structured data , such as trees , are transformed into dense vectors according to the Nystro ¨ m methodology , and the NN is effective in capturing non-linearities in these representations , but still improving generalization at a reasonable complexity . At the best our knowledge, this work is one of the few attempts to systematically integrate linguistic kernels within a deep neural network architecture. The problem of combining such methodologies has been studied in specific works, such as ( Baldi et al., 2011; Cho and Saul, 2009; Yu et al., 2009 ). In Baldi et al.

The authors transform the kernel regularizer into a loss function and carry out the neural network training by gradient descent . In Zhuang et al.

Notice that other low-dimensional approximations of kernel functions have been studied, as for example the randomized feature mappings proposed in Rahimi and Recht ( 2008 ).

The Nystro ¨ m method adopted here does not suffer of such limitations : as our target is the application to structured ( linguistic ) data , more general kernels , i.e . , non-shift-invariant convolution kernels are needed . Given the Nystro¨m approximation, the learning setting corresponds to a general well-known neural network architecture, i.e., a multilayer perceptron, and does not require any manual feature engineering or the design of ad-hoc network architectures. The success in three different tasks confirms its large applicability without major changes or adaptations. Second, we propose a novel learning strategy, as the capability of kernel methods to represent complex search spaces is combined with the ability of neural networks to find non-linear solutions to complex tasks.

        "input": "Spectral Analysis of Information Density in Dialogue Predicts Collaborative Task Performance Abstract We propose a perspective on dialogue that focuses on relative information contributions of conversation partners as a key to successful communication. We predict the success of collaborative task in English and Danish corpora of task-oriented dialogue. Two features are extracted from the frequency domain representations of the lexical entropy series of each interlocutor, power spectrum overlap ( PSO ) and relative phase ( RP ). We find that PSO is a negative predictor of task success, while RP is a positive one. An SVM with these features significantly improved on previous task success prediction models . Our findings suggest that the strategic distribution of information density between interlocutors is relevant to task success. 1 Introduction What factors affect whether information is conveyed effectively and reliably in conversations? Several theoretical frameworks have emerged that model dialogical behavior at different granularity levels. Can we use them to measure communicative effectiveness? Grounding theory ( Clark and Brennan, 1991 ) models a successful communication as a process during which “common ground” ( i.e., mutual knowledge, beliefs etc. ) is jointly built among interlocutors. The interactive alignment model ( IAM ) ( Pickering and Garrod , 2004 ) proposes that the ultimate goal of dialogue is the alignment of interlocutors ’ situational model , which is helped by alignment at all other lower representation levels ( e.g . , lexical , syntactic etc . , driven by the psychologically well-documented priming effects .",

        "input": "Recently , empirical studies have verified the explanatory powers of the above-mentioned theories , especially the IAM , utilizing dialogues recorded and transcribed from various collaborative tasks conducted in laboratory settings ( Reitter and Moore , 2007 ; Reitter and Moore , 2014 ; Fusaroli et al . , 2012 ; Fusaroli and Tyle ´ n , 2016 ) . In those studies, the quality of communication is directly reflected in the collaborative performance of interlocutors, i.e., how successful they are in accomplishing the task. Although they do not come to fully agree on which theoretical accounts of dialogue ( e.g., interactive alignment vs. interpersonal synergy ) provides better explanations ( see Section 2.1 for details ), the majority of these studies have confirmed that the alignment of certain linguistic markers, lexical items, or syntactic rules between interlocutors correlates with task success. What is missing from the picture, however, is the computational understanding of how strategies of interaction and the mix of information contributions to the conversation facilitate successful communication. This is understandable because those higher level concepts do not directly map onto the atomic linguistic elements and thus are much more difficult to define and operationalize. In the present study, we intend to explore this missing part of work by characterizing how the interaction between interlocutors in terms of their information contributions affects the quality of communication. 1.1 An information-based approach Recent work has already used information theory to study the dynamics of dialogue. Xu and Reitter ( 2016b ) observed that the amount of lexical information ( measured by entropy ) from interlocutors of different roles, converges within the span of topic episodes in natural spoken dialogue. Anon ( 2017 ) interpret this converging pattern as a reflection of the dynamic process in which the information contributed by two interlocutors fluctuates in a complementary way at the early stage, and gradually reaches an equilibrium status. Xu and Reitter ( 2016b ) also correlated this entropy converging pattern with the topic shift phenomenon that frequently occurs in natural conversation ( Ng and Bradac, 1993 ), and proposed that it reflects the process of interlocutors building the common ground that is necessary for the ongoing topics of conversation. Based on Xu and Reitter’s ( 2016 ) finding that entropy converging pattern repeatedly occurs within dialogue ( though not necessarily at strictly regular intervals ), it is reasonable to expect that after applying some spectral analysis techniques ( time space to frequency space conversion ) to the entropy series of dialogue, the frequency space representations should demonstrate some patterns that are distinct from white noise, because the periodicity properties in time space are captured.",

        "input": "Furthermore, we expect that how the frequency representations of two interlocutors correlate provides some information about the higher level properties of dialogue, e.g., the task performance etc. The thought is intuitive: If we imagine the entropy series from two interlocutors as two ideal sinusoidal signals s1 and s2 ( supposedly of different frequencies, f1 and f2 ) ( Figure 1 ), then the observed converging pattern can be thought of as a segment from the full spans of the signals. Then the frequency space properties, such as how close f1 and f2 are, and the phase difference φ between them, will definitely affect the shape of the converging pattern ( solid lines in Figure 1 ). As Xu and Reitter ( 2016b ) argues that the converging segment reflects the grounding process between interlocutors, it is reasonable to expect that the shape and length of this segment are reflective of how well interlocutors understand each other, and the overall collaborative performance as well. Based on the above considerations, the goal of the present study is to explore how the frequency space representations of the entropy series of dialogue are correlated with the collaborative performance of task. We first demonstrate that entropy series satisfy the prerequisites of spectral analysis techniques in Section 4. Then we use two frequency space statistics, power spectrum overlap ( PSO ) and relative phase ( RP ), to predict task success. The reasons of using these two specific indices are discussed in Section 2.3, and their definitions are given in Section 3.3. The results are shown in Sections 5 to 7, and the implications are discussed. 2 Related Work 2.1 The success of dialogue The interactive-alignment model ( IAM ) ( Pickering and Garrod , 2004 ) stipulates that communication is successful to the extent that communicators “ understand relevant aspects of the world in the same way as each other ” ( Garrod and Pickering , 2009 ) .

        "input": "Anderson, 1987; Pickering and Garrod, 2006; Reitter and Moore, 2014 ) have revealed that the alignment of linguistic elements at different representation levels between interlocutors facilitates the success of task-oriented dialogues. More recently , different theoretical accounts other than IAM , such as interpersonal synergy ( Fusaroli et al . , 2014 ) and complexity matching ( Abney et al . , 2014 ) have been proposed to explain the mechanism of successful dialogue from the perspective of dynamic systems . Fusaroli and Tyle´n ( 2016 ) compare the approaches of interactive alignment and interpersonal synergy in terms of how well they predict the collective performance in a joint task. They find that the synergy approach is a better predictor than the alignment approach. Abney et al. ( 2014 ) differentiate the concepts of behavior matching and complexity matching in dyadic interaction. They demonstrate the acoustic onset events in speech signals exhibit power law clustering across timescales, and the complexity matching in these power law functions is reflective of whether the conversation is affiliative or argumentative. The perspective taken by the present study has some common places with Fusaroli and Tyle´n ( 2016 ) and Abney et al.’s ( 2014 ) work: we view dialogue as an interaction of two dynamic systems. The joint decision-making task used by Fusaroli and Tyle´n ( 2016 ) resulted in a small corpus of dialogue in Danish, which we will use for the present study. 2.2 Information density in natural language Information Theory ( Shannon, 1948 ) predicts that the optimal way to communicate is to send information at a constant rate, a.k.a. the principle of entropy rate constancy ( ERC ). The way humans use natural language to communicate also follows this principle: by computing the local per-word entropy of the sentence ( which, under the prediction of ERC, will increase with sentence position ), ERC is confirmed in both written text ( Genzel and Charniak, 2002; Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Keller, 2004; Qian and Jaeger, 2011 ) and spoken dialogue ( Xu and Reitter, 2016b; Xu and Reitter, 2016a ).

        "input": "The information density in language, i.e., the distribution of entropy ( predictability ), reveal the discourse structure to some extent. For example, entropy drops at the boundaries between topics ( Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Qian and Jaeger, 2011 ), and increases within a topic episode in dialogue ( Xu and Reitter, 2016b ) ( see Section 1.1 ). The entropy of microblog text reflects changes in contextual information ( e.g., an unexpected event in a sports game ) ( Doyle and Frank, 2015 ). In sum, per-word entropy quantifies the amount of lexical information in natural language, and therefore fulfills the needs of modeling the information contribution from interlocutors. 2.3 Spectral analysis methodology Spectral analysis, also referred to as frequency domain analysis, is a pervasively used technique in physics, engineering, economics and social sciences. The key idea of it is to decompose a complex signal in time space into simpler components in frequency space, using mathematical operations such as Fourier transform ( Bracewell, 1986 ). The application of spectral analysis in human language technology mainly focuses on processing the acoustic signals of human voice, and capturing the para-linguistics features relevant to certain tasks ( Schuller et al., 2013 ). For example, Bitouk et al. ( 2010 ) find that utterance-level spectral features are useful for emotion recognition. Gregory Jr and Gallagher ( 2002 ) demonstrate that spectral information beneath 0.5 kHz can predict US president election outcomes. However, we are not aware of the usage of spectral analysis in studying linguistic phenomena at higher representation levels than the acoustic level. For our study, we are looking for some techniques that can capture the coupling between two signals at frequency space.",

Therefore, studies outside the field of speech communication and linguistics could also be enlightening to our work. After searching the literature, we find that the spectral analysis techniques that Oullier et al. ( 2002 ) and Oullier et al. ( 2008 ) use to study the physical and social functions of human body movement are useful to our research goal. In Oullier et al.’s ( 2002 ) work, subjects stood in a moving room and were to track a target attached to the wall. A frequency space statistics, power spectrum overlap ( PSO ), was used to demonstrate the coupling between motion of the room and motion of the subject’s head. Stronger coupling effect ( higher PSO ) was found in the tracking task than a no-tracking baseline. PSO in nature quantifies how much the frequency space representations of two signals ( power spectrum density ) overlap. It allows us to explore the frequency space coupling of two interlocutors’ entropy series in dialogue. Similarly, Oullier et al. ( 2008 ) used the metrics of peak-to-peak relative phase ( RP ) and PSO to study the spontaneous synchrony in behavior that emerges between interactants as a result of information exchange. The signals to be analyzed were the flexion-extension movement of index fingers of two subjects sitting in front of each other.",

One of them plays as the instruction giver, who has routes marked on her map, and the other plays as the instruction follower, who does not have routes. The task for them is to reproduce the giver’s route on the follower’s map. The participants are free to speak, but they cannot see each other’s map.

In Fusaroli et al.’s ( 2012 ) original study the participants were to accomplish a series of visual perception task trials, by discussing the stimuli they saw and reaching a joint decision for each trial. The collaborative performance is measured by the CollectivePerformance variable, which is based on a psychometric function that measures the sensitivity of the dyad’s joint decision to the actual contrast difference of the trial ( Fusaroli et al., 2012 ). Higher value of this variable indicates better task performance. The Switchboard Corpus ( Godfrey et al . , 1992 ) is used to train the language model for estimating the sentence entropy in Map Task . The Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks Corpus1 is used for the same purpose for DJD . 3.2 Estimating information density in dialogue The information density of language is estimated at the sentence level , by computing the per-word entropy of each sentence using a trigram language model trained from a different corpus . We consider a sentence to be a sequence of words , S = { w1 , w2 , . . . , wn } , and the per-word entropy is estimated by : whereP ( wi | w1 . . . wi − 1 ) is estimated by a trigram model that is trained from an outside corpus .

For the k th dialogue whose total utterance number is Nk, we mark it as Dk = {uki | i = 1, 2, . . . , Nk}, in which uki is the i th utterance. Map Task contains annotations of sentence structure in utterances , and one utterance could consist of several sentences that are syntactically independent . Thus we further split Dk into a sequence of sentence, Dk = {ski | i = 1, 2, . . . , N ′k}, in whichN ′k is number of sentences in Dk. Since DJD lacks the sentence annotations , we do not further split the utterance sequence , and simply treat an utterance as a complete sentence . Given a sequence {ski } ( Map Task ), or {uki } ( DJD ), we calculate the per-word entropy for each item in the sequence: where H( ski  ) or H( u k i  ) is computed according to Equation 1. Then we split the entropy series Hk into two sub-series by the source of utterances ( i.e., who speaks them ), resulting in HAk for interlocutor A, and HBk for interlocutor B. For Map Task , the two interlocutors have distinct roles , instruction giver and follower . Thus the resulting two entropy series are Hgk and H f k . These per-interlocutor entropy series will be the input of our next-step spectral analysis. 3.3 Computing power spectrum overlap and relative phase The time intervals between utterances ( or sentences ) vary, but since we care about the average information contribution within a complete semantic unit, we treat entropy series as regular time series.",

        "input": "The time scale is not measured in seconds but in turns ( or sentences ). For a given dialogue Dk , we apply the fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) on its two entropy series HAk and H B k , and obtain the power spectra ( or , power spectral density plots ) of them , PAk and PBk . The power spectra are estimated with the periodogram method provided by the open source R software . The Y axis of a power spectrum is the squared amplitude of signal ( or power ), and X axis ranges from 0 to pi/2 ( we do not have sampling frequency, thus the X axis is in angular frequency but not in Hz ). The power spectrum overlap, PSOk, is calculated by computing the common area under the curves of PAk and P B k is calculated, and normalizing by the total area of the two curves ( see Figure 2 ). PSOk ranges from 0 to 1, and a larger value indicates higher similarity between PAk and P B k . The relative phase ( RP ) between HAk and H B k is directly returned by the spectrum function in R. It is a vector of real numbers that range from 0 to pi, and each element represent the phase difference between two signals at a particular frequency position of the spectrum. 4 Prerequisites of Spectral Analysis Before proceeding to the actual analysis, we first examine whether the data we use satisfy some of the prerequisites of spectral analysis techniques. One common assumption of Fourier transforms is that the signals ( time series ) are stationary ( Dwivedi and Subba Rao, 2011 ). Stationarity means that the mean, variance and other distributional properties do not change over time ( Natrella, 2010 ).",

        "input": "Another presumption we hold is that the entropy series contain some periodic patterns ( see Section 1.1 ), which means their power spectrum should differ from that of white noise. 4.1 Examine stationarity We use three pervasively used statistical tests to test the stationarity of our entropy series data : the augmented Dickey-Fuller ( ADF ) test ( Dickey and Fuller , 1979 ) , the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin ( KPSS ) test ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 1992 ) , and the Phillips-Perron ( PP ) test ( Phillips and Perron , 1988 ) . The percentage of entropy series that pass the stationarity tests are shown in Table 1. We can see that the majority of our data satisfy the assumption of stationarity , and thus it is valid to conduct Fourier transform on the entropy series . The stationarity property seems contradictory to the previous findings about entropy increase in written text and spoken dialogue ( Genzel and Charniak, 2002; Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Xu and Reitter, 2016b ), because stationarity predicts that the mean entropy stays constant over time. We examine this in our data by fitting a simple linear model with entropy as the dependent, and sentence position as the independent variable, which yields significant ( marginal ) effects of the latter: For Map Task, β = 2.3× 10−3, p < .05, Adj-R2 = 1.7× 10−4; For DJD, β = 7.2× 10−5, p = .06, Adj-R2 = 2.2× 10−4. It indicates that the stationarity of entropy series does not conflict with the entropy increasing trend predicted by the principle of ERC ( Shannon, 1948 ). We conjecture that stationarity satisfies because the effect size ( Adj-R2 ) of entropy increase is very small. 4.2 Comparison with white noise Power spectra for all entropy series are obtained with an FFT . We compare them with those of white noise. The white noise data are simulated with i.i.d. random data points that are generated from normal distributions ( same means and standard deviations as the actual data ).

        "input": "White noise signals should demonstrate a constant power spectral density ( Narasimhan and Veena, 2005 ), and if the entropy series is not completely random, then their average spectrum should be flat. Linear models show that the average spectrums of the entropy data have slopes that are significantly larger than zero ( For Map Task, β = 2.3× 10−2, SE = 9.4× 10−3, p < .05; for DJD, β = 314.1, SE = 19.8, p < .001 ), while the slopes of the white noise data are not significantly different from zero. This confirms our presumption that the entropy series of dialogue contains some periodic patterns that are identifiable in frequency space. We also conduct Ljung-Box test ( Ljung and Box , 1978 ) to examine how the entropy series is different from white noise . The null hypothesis is that the time series being tested is independent of the lagged sequence of itself. The test on a white noise series will give big p-values, for any lags greater than 0, because of its randomness nature. We try several lags on each entropy series, and pick the smallest p-value. Consequently , we obtain a mean p-value of .23 on MapTask , and a mean p-value of .27 on DJD . Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis for all the entropy series data, but the Type-I error of considering them as different form white noise is pretty low. 5 PSO Predicts Task Success 5.1 Results of linear models We compute PSO for all the dialogues in Map Task and DJD and fit two linear models using PSO as predictor , with PATHDEV and CollectivePerformance as dependent variables respectively .

Since PATHDEV is a measure of failure, but collaborative task performance is a measure of success, the negative correlation between PSO and collaborative task performance is consistent. Regression lines with residuals are plotted in Figure 4. Figure 4 ( a ) suggests a heteroscedasticity problem, because the right half of data points seem to stretch up along the y axis. This was confirmed by a Breush-Pagan test ( Breusch and Pagan , 1979 ) ( BP = 5.62 , p < .05 ) . To rectify this issue , we adopt a Box-Cox transformation ( Box and Cox , 1964 ) on the dependent variable , PATHDEV , which is a typical way of handling heteroscedasticity . The new model that uses PSO to predict the Box-Cox transformed PATHDEV also yields significant coefficients : β = 3.85 , SE = 1.67 , F ( 1 , 113 ) = 5.32 , p < .05 . Therefore, the correlation between PSO and PATHDEV is reliable.

        "input": "By “synchrony”, we mean an overlap in the frequencies at which they choose to inject novel information into the conversation. This conclusion seems contradictory to the perspective of interactive alignment at the first glance. However, here we are starting with a very high-level model of dialogue that has does not refer to linguistic devices. Instead, we utilize the concept of “information density” and the entropy metric of natural language, to paint the picture of a system in which communicators inject novelty into the dialogue, and that each communicator does so regularly and with a set of overlapping frequencies. We assume that the rapid change of sentence entropy, i.e., the high frequency components in the spectrum, correspond to the moments in conversation where one interlocutor brings relatively novel content to the table, such as a detailed instruction, a strange question, an unexpected response etc. This assumption is reasonable because previous work has shown that sudden change in entropy predicts topic change in dialogue ( Genzel and Charniak, 2003; Qian and Jaeger, 2011; Xu and Reitter, 2016b ). We argue that higher synchrony ( larger overlap in frequency space ) in terms of how much novelty each interlocutor contributes, does not necessarily leads to better outcomes of communication. Rather, we would expect the correlation to be opposite ( and our empirical results confirm this ), because dialogue is a joint activity, in which a taking on different roles as interlocutors ( e.g., the one who gives orders versus the one who follows ) is often required to push the activity along ( Clark, 1996 ). A dialogue with maximal synchrony or frequency overlap would be one where partners take turns at regular intervals. Perhaps because such regularity in turn-taking assigns no special roles to interlocutors, and because they engage in turntaking with no regard for content, it is not strange that such synchrony is disadvantageous.",

        "input": "Let’s look at several scenarios of different synchrony levels between interlocutors: First, high synchrony due to both interlocutors contributing large amount of new information, which means there is more overlap near the high frequency band of spectrums. In this case, they are more likely to have difficulty in comprehending each other due to the potential information overload. Situations such as arguing, or both speakers asking a lot of questions are good examples. Second, high synchrony due to both interlocutors providing ineffective information, which indicates overlap in spectrums near the low frequency band. Obviously this type of ineffective communication is not helpful to the collaborative task. Third, low synchrony due to one interlocutor providing more information and the other one providing less, which means the overlap in spectrums is minimum. An example of this case is that one interlocutor is saying something important, while the other one is producing short utterances such “uh-huh”, “yes”, or short questions to make sure that they are on the same page, which is known as the back-channel mechanism in conversation ( Orestro¨m, 1983 ). This complementary style of communication allows them to build mutual understand of each other’s intention, and thus reaches better collaborative performance. 6 RP Predicts Task Success 6.1 Results of linear models We obtain the relative phase ( RP ) vector ( absolute values ) of all frequency components, and fit linear models using the mean of RP as predictor, and task performance as the dependent variable. We get non-significant coefficients for both models : For Map Task , F ( 1 , 113 ) = .004 , p > .05 ; for DJD , F ( 1 , 14 ) = .772 , p > .05 .

        "input": "The power spectra describe the distribution of energy across the span of frequency components that compose the signal. The frequency components with higher energy ( peaks in spectrum ) are more dominant than those with lower energy ( troughs ) in determining the nature of the signal. Therefore it makes sense to only include the peak frequencies into the model, because they are more “representative” of the signal, and so the “noise” from the low energy frequencies are filtered out. Thus we obtain RP from the local peak frequency components, and use the mean, median, and maximum values of them as predictors. It turns out that for Map Task , the maximum of RP is a significant predictor ( the mean and median are left out via stepwise analysis ) . For DJD , the mean of RP is a significant predictor of task success ( when median and maximum are included in the model ) . ( see Table 3 ) . ( see Table 3 ). From the significant effect of maximum RP in Map Task and mean RP in DJD , it is safe to state that RP is positively correlated with task performance . However, this relationship is not as straight-forward as PSO, because of the marginal effect at the opposite direction. A more finegrained analysis is required, but it is outside the scope of this study. 6.2 Discussion The relative phase in frequency space can be understood as the “lag” between signals in time space. Imagine that we align the two entropy series from one dialogue onto the same time scale ( just like Figure 1 ), the distance between the entropy “peaks” is proportionate to the relative phase in frequency space.",

        "input": "Then, the positive correlation between relative phase and task performance suggests that relatively large delays between entropy “surges” seen in each interlocutor are beneficial to collaborative performance. The delay of entropy surges can be understood as a strategy for an interlocutor to distribute information in his or her own utterance accordingly with the information received. For example, after interlocutor A contributes a big piece of information, the other one, B, does not rush to make new substantial contributions, but instead keeps her utterances at low entropy until it is the proper time to take a turn to contribute. This does not have to coincide with dialogic turn-taking. This delay gives B more time to “digest” the information provided by A, which could be an instruction that needs to be comprehended, or a question that needs to be thought about and so on. A relatively long delay guarantees enough time for interlocutors to reach mutual understanding. On the contrary, if B rushes to speak a lot shortly after the A’s input, then it will probably cause information overload and be harmful to communication. Therefore, we believe that the RP statistic captures the extent to which interlocutors manage the proper “timing” of information contribution to maintain effective communication. 7 Prediction Task Here we explore whether the frequency domain features , PSO and RP , can help with an existing framework that utilizes alignment features , such as the repetition of lexical and syntactic elements , to predict the success of dialogue in MapTask ( Reitter and Moore , 2007 ) . R & M described an SVM model that takes into the repetition count of lexicons ( LEXREP ) and syntax structures ( SYNREP ) , and the length of dialogues ( LENGTH ) as features . The full model achieves an R2 score of .17, which means that it can account for 17% of the variance of task success.",

        "input": "We add the new PSO and RP ( mean , median and maximum RP features per dialogue are included ) covariates to the original SVM model . An RBF kernel ( γ = 5 ) was used. The cost parameter C was ( coarsely ) tuned on different cross-validation folds to reduce overfitting on this relatively small dataset, and the R&M’s original full model was recalculated ( shown in Table 4 as R&M ). Two models with PSO and RP interactions ( once without the alignment/repetition features ) are shown for comparison. ( See Table 4 ). Significant improvement in the model’s explanatory power, i.e., R2, is gained after the PSO and RP features are added. The best model we have is by adding PSO and RP as predictors without the interaction term ( bold number in Table 4 ), which gives about 60% increase of R2 compared to R&M’s full model. Note that even if we exclude the alignment features, and include only ( LENGTH ) and the frequency features ( last row in Table 4 ), the performance also exceeds R&M’s full model. The results indicate that the frequency domain features ( PSO and RP ) of the sentence information density can capture some hidden factors of task success that are unexplained by the alignment approach. It is not surprising that how people coordinate their information contribution matters a lot to the success of the collaboration.

Our work adds a brick to the series of endeavors on studying the linguistic and behavioral factors of successful dialogue, and for the first time ( as far as we know ) demonstrates quantitatively that the dynamics of not just “what” and “how” we say, but also “how much” we say and the “timing” of distributing what we say in dialogue, are relevant to the quality of communication. Although the way we model information in language is simply the entropy at lexical level, we believe the findings still reveal the nature of information production and processing in dialogue. We hope that by comparing and combining our methodology with other approaches of studying dialogue, we can reach a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of this common yet mysterious human practice.",

        "input": "Unsupervised Learning of Distributional Relation Vectors Abstract Word embedding models such as GloVe rely on co-occurrence statistics to learn vector representations of word meaning . While we may similarly expect that cooccurrence statistics can be used to capture rich information about the relationships between different words, existing approaches for modeling such relationships are based on manipulating pre-trained word vectors. In this paper, we introduce a novel method which directly learns relation vectors from co-occurrence statistics. To this end , we first introduce a variant of GloVe , in which there is an explicit connection between word vectors and PMI weighted co-occurrence vectors . We then show how relation vectors can be naturally embedded into the resulting vector space. 1 Introduction Word embeddings are vector space representations of word meaning ( Mikolov et al., 2013b; Pennington et al., 2014 ). A remarkable property of these models is that they capture various lexical relationships, beyond mere similarity. For example, ( Mikolov et al., 2013b ) found that analogy questions of the form “a is to b what c is to ?” can often be answered by finding the word d that maximizes cos( wb−wa+wc, wd ), where we write wx for the vector representation of a word x. Intuitively, the word vector wa represents a in terms of its most salient features. For example, wparis implicitly encodes that Paris is located in France and that it is a capital city, which is intuitively why the ‘capital of’ relation can be modeled in terms of a vector difference. Other relationships, however, such as the fact that Macron succeeded Hollande as president of France, are unlikely to be captured by word embeddings.",

        "input": "Relation extraction methods can discover such information by analyzing sentences that contain both of the words or entities involved ( Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010; dos Santos et al., 2015 ), but they typically need a large number of training examples to be effective. A third alternative, which we consider in this paper, is to characterize the relatedness between two words s and t by learning a relation vector rst in an unsupervised way from corpus statistics. Among others, such vectors can be used to find word pairs that are similar to a given word pair ( i.e. finding analogies ), or to find the most prototypical examples among a given set of relation instances. They can also be used as an alternative to the aforementioned relation extraction methods, by subsequently training a classifier that uses the relation vectors as input, which might be particularly effective in cases where only limited amounts of training data are available ( with the case of analogy finding from a single instance being an extreme example ). The most common unsupervised approach for learning relation vectors consists of averaging the embeddings of the words that occur in between s and t, in sentences that contain both ( Weston et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2015; Hashimoto et al., 2015 ). While this strategy is often surprisingly effective ( Hill et al., 2016 ), it is sub-optimal for two reasons. First, many of the words co-occurring with s and t will be semantically related to s or to t, but will not actually be descriptive for the relationship between s and t; e.g. the vector describing the relation between Paris and France should not be affected by words such as eiffel ( which only relates to Paris ). Second, it gives too much weight to stopwords, which cannot be addressed in a straightforward way as some stop-words are actually crucial for modeling relationships ( e.g. prepositions such as ‘in’ or ‘of’ or Hearst patterns ( Indurkhya and Damerau, 2010 ) ). In this paper, we propose a method for learning relation vectors directly from co-occurrence statistics. We first introduce a variant of GloVe , in which word vectors can be directly interpreted as smoothed PMI-weighted bag-of-words representations .",

        "input": "We then represent relationships between words as weighted bag-of-words representations , using generalizations of PMI to three arguments , and learn vectors that correspond to smoothed versions of these representations . As far as the possible applications of our methodology is concerned, we imagine that relation vectors can be used in various ways to enrich the input to neural network models. As a simple example, in a question answering system, we could “annotate” mentions of entities with relation vectors encoding their relationship to the different words from the question. As another example, we could consider a recommendation system which takes advantage of vectors expressing the relationship between items that have been bought ( or viewed ) by a customer and other items from the catalogue. Finally, relation vectors should also be useful for knowledge completion, especially in cases where few training examples per relation type are given ( meaning that neural network models could not be used ) and where relations cannot be predicted from the already available knowledge ( meaning that knowledge graph embedding methods could not be used, or are at least not sufficient ). 2 Related Work The problem of characterizing the relationship between two words has been studied in various settings. From a learning point of view, the most straightforward setting is where we are given labeled training sentences, with each label explicitly indicating what relationship is expressed in the sentence. This fully supervised setting has been the focus of several evaluation campaigns, including as part of ACE ( Doddington et al., 2004 ) and at SemEval 2010 ( Hendrickx et al., 2010 ). A key problem with this setting, however, is that labeled training data is hard to obtain. A popular alternative is to use known instances of the relations of interest as a form of distant supervision ( Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010 ). Some authors have also considered unsupervised relation extraction methods ( Shinyama and Sekine, 2006; Banko et al., 2007 ), in which case the aim is essentially to find clusters of patterns that express similar relationships, although these relationships may not correspond to the ones that are needed for the considered application.",

        "input": "Finally , several systems have also used bootstrapping strategies ( Brin , 1998 ; Agichtein and Gravano , 2000 ; Carlson et al . , 2010 ) , where a small set of instances are used to find extraction patterns , which are used to find more instances , which can in turn be used to find better extraction patterns , etc . Traditionally, relation extraction systems have relied on a variety of linguistic features, such as lexical patterns, part-of-speech tags and dependency parsers. More recently, several neural network architectures have been proposed for the relation extraction problem. These architectures rely on word embeddings to represent the words in the input sentence, and manipulate these word vectors to construct a relation vector. Some approaches simply represent the sentence ( or the phrase connecting the entities whose relationship we want to determine ) as a sequence of words , and use e.g . convolutional networks to aggregate the vectors of the words in this sequence ( Zeng et al . , 2014 ; dos Santos et al . , 2015 ) . Another possibility , explored in ( Socher et al . , 2012 ) , is to use parse trees to capture the structure of the sentence , and to use recursive neural networks ( RNNs ) to aggregate the word vectors in a way which respects this structure . A similar approach is taken in ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) , where LSTMs are applied to the shortest path between the two target words in a dependency parser . A straightforward baseline method is to simply take the average of the word vectors ( Mitchell and Lapata, 2010 ). While conceptually much simpler, variants of this approach have obtained state-of-the-art performance for relation classification ( Hashimoto et al., 2015 ) and a variety of tasks that require sentences to be represented as a vector ( Hill et al., 2016 ). Given the effectiveness of word vector averaging, in ( Kenter et al., 2016 ) a model was proposed that explicitly tries to learn word vectors that generalize well when being averaged.",

        "input": "Similarly, the model proposed in ( Hashimoto et al., 2015 ) aims to produce word vectors that perform well for the specific task of relation classification. The ParagraphVector method from ( Le and Mikolov , 2014 ) is related to the aformentioned approaches , but it explicitly learns a vector representation for each paragraph along with the word embeddings . However, this method is computationally expensive, and often fails to outperform simpler approaches ( Hill et al., 2016 ). To the best of our knowledge, existing methods for learning relation vectors are all based on manipulating pre-trained word vectors. In contrast, we will directly learn relation vectors from corpus statistics, which will have the important advantage that we can focus on words that describe the interaction between the two words s and t, i.e. words that commonly occur in sentences that contain both s and t, but are comparatively rare in sentences that only contain s or only contain t. Finally , note that our work is fundamentally different from Knowledge Graph Embedding ( KGE ) ( Wang et al . , 2014b ) , ( Wang et al . , 2014a ) , ( Bordes et al . , 2011 ) in at least two ways : ( i ) KGE models start from a structured knowledge graph whereas we only take a text corpus as input , and ( ii ) KGE models represent relations as geometric objects in the “ entity embedding ” itself ( e.g . as translations , linear maps , combinations of projections and translations , etc ) , whereas we represent words and relations in different vector spaces . 3 Word Vectors as PMI Encodings Our approach to relation embedding is based on a variant of the GloVe word embedding model ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) . In this section , we first briefly recall the GloVe model itself , after which we discuss our proposed variant . A key advantage of this variant is that it allows us to directly interpret word vectors in terms of the Pointwise Mutual Information ( PMI ) , which will be central to the way in which we learn relation vectors . 3.1 Background The GloVe model ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) learns a vector wi for each word i in the vocabulary , based on a matrix of co-occurrence counts , encoding how often two words appear within a given window . Let us write xij for the number of times word j appears in the context of word i in some text corpus. More precisely, assume that there are m sentences in the corpus, and letP li ⊆ {1, ..., nl} be the set of positions from the lth sentence where the word i can be found ( with nl the length of the sentence ).",

        "input": "Then xij is defined as follows: where weight( p, q ) = 1|p−q| if 0 < |p − q| ≤ W , and weight( p, q ) = 0 otherwise, where the window size W is usually set to 5 or 10. The GloVe model learns for each word i two vectors wi and w ˜ i by optimizing the following objective : where f is a weighting function , aimed at reducing the impact of rare terms , and bi and b ˜ j are bias terms . The GloVe model is closely related to the notion of pointwise mutual information ( PMI ) , which is defined for two words i and j as PMI ( i , j ) = log ( P ( i , j ) P ( i ) P ( j ) ) , where P ( i , j ) is the probability of seeing the words i and j if we randomly pick a word position from the corpus and a second word position within distance W from the first position . The PMI between i and j is usually estimated as follows : where xi ∗ = ∑ j xij , x ∗ j = ∑ i xij and x ∗ ∗ = ∑ i ∑ j xij . In particular , it is straightforward to see that after the reparameterization given by bi 7 → bi + log xi ∗ − log x ∗ ∗ and bj 7 → bj + log x ∗ j , the GloVe model is equivalent to . 3.2 A Variant of GloVe In this paper , we will use the following variant of the formulation in ( 1 ) : Despite its similarity , this formulation differs from the GloVe model in a number of important ways . First, we use smoothed frequency counts instead of the observed frequency counts xij . In particular , the PMI between words i and j is given as : where the probabilities are estimated as follows : where α ≥ 0 is a parameter controlling the amount of smoothing and n is the size of the vocabulary . This ensures that the estimation of PMI ( i , j ) is well-defined even in cases where xij = 0 , meaning that we no longer have to restrict the inner summation to those j for which xij > 0 . For efficiency reasons , in practice , we only consider a small subset of all context words j for which xij = 0 , which is similar in spirit to the use of negative sampling in Skip-gram ( Mikolov et al . , 2013b ) . In particular, the set Ji contains each j such that xij > 0 as well as M uniformly1 sampled context words j for which xij = 0, where we choose M = 2 · |{j : xij > 0}|.",

        "input": "Second, following ( Jameel and Schockaert, 2016 ), the weighting function f( xij ) has been replaced by 1 σ2j , where σ2j is the residual variance of the regression problem for context word j, estimated follows: with J−1j = {i : j ∈ Ji}. Since we need the word vectors to estimate this residual variance , we reestimate σ2j after every five iterations of the SGD optimization . For the first 5 iterations , where no estimation for σ2j is available , we use the GloVe weighting function . The use of smoothed frequency counts and residual variance based weighting make the word embedding model more robust for rare words. For instance, if w only co-occurs with a handful of other terms, it is important to prioritize the most informative context words, which is exactly what the use of the residual variance achieves, i.e. σ2j is small for informative terms and large for stop words; see ( Jameel and Schockaert, 2016 ). This will be important for modeling relations, as the relation vectors will often have to be estimated from very sparse co-occurrence counts. Finally, the bias term bi has been omitted from the model in ( 2 ). We have empirically found that omitting this bias term does not affect the performance of the model , while it allows us to have a more direct connection between the vector wi and the corresponding PMI scores . 3.3 Word Vectors and PMI Let us define PMIW as follows: Clearly, when the word vectors are trained according to ( 2 ), it holds that PMIW ( i, j ) ≈ PMIS( i, j ). In other words, we can think of the word vector wi as a low-dimensional encoding of the vector ( PMIS( i, 1 ), ...,PMIS( i, n ) ), with n the number of words in the vocabulary.

In other words , the vector translation wi − wk encodes for each context word j the ( log ) ratio of the probability of seeing j in the context of i and in the context of k , which is in line with the original motivation underlying the GloVe model ( Pennington et al . , 2014 ) . In the following section , we will propose a number of alternative vector representations for the relationship between two words , based on generalizations of PMI to three arguments . 4 Learning Global Relation Vectors We now turn to the problem of learning a vector rik that encodes how the source word i and target word k are related. The main underlying idea is that rik will capture which context words j are most closely associated with the word pair ( i, k ). Whereas the GloVe model is based on statistics about ( main word , context word ) pairs , here we will need statistics on ( source word , context word , target word ) triples . First , we discuss how cooccurrence statistics among three words can be expressed using generalizations of PMI to three arguments . Then we explain how this can be used to learn relation vectors in natural way. 4.1 Co-occurrence Statistics for Triples Let P li ⊆ {1, ..., nl} again be the set of positions from the lth sentence corresponding to word i.

        "input": "In other words, yijk reflects the ( weighted ) number of times word j appears between words i and k in a sentence in which i and k occur sufficiently close to each other, in that order. Note that by taking word order into account in this way, we will be able to model asymmetric relationships. To model how strongly a context word j is associated with the word pair ( i , k ) , we will consider the following two well-known generalizations of PMI to three arguments ( Van de Cruys , 2011 ) : where P ( i , j , k ) is the probability of seeing the word triple ( i , j , k ) when randomly choosing a sentence and three ( ordered ) word positions in that sentence within a window size of W . In addition we will also consider two ways in which PMI can be used more directly : Note that SI3 ( i , j , k ) corresponds to the PMI between ( i , k ) and j , whereas SI4 ( i , j , k ) is the PMI between i and k conditioned on the fact that j occurs . The measures SI3 and SI4 are closely related to SI1 and SI2 respectively2. In particular, the following identities are easy to show: Using smoothed versions of the counts yijk, we can use the following probability estimates for SI1( i, j, k )–SI4( i, j, k ): where yij∗ = ∑ k yijk, and similar for the other counts. For efficiency reasons , the counts of the form yij ∗ , yi ∗ k and y ∗ jk are pre-computed for all word pairs , which can be done efficiently due to the sparsity of co-occurrence counts ( i.e . these counts will be 0 for most pairs of words ) , similarly to how to the counts xij are computed in GloVe . From these counts, we can also efficiently pre-compute the counts yi∗∗, y∗j∗, y∗∗k and y∗∗∗. On the other hand, the counts yijk cannot be precomputed, since the total number of triples for which yijk 6= 0 is prohibitively high in a typical corpus. However, using an inverted index, we can efficiently retrieve the sentences that contain the words i and k, and since this number of sentences is typically small, we can efficiently obtain the counts yijk corresponding to a given pair ( i, k ) whenever they are needed. 4.2 Relation Vectors Our aim is to learn a vector rik that models the relationship between i and k.",

We have noticed that in most of the cases the value of α was automatically selected as 0.00001. To efficiently compute the triples , we have used the Zettair3 retrieval engine . As our main baselines, we use three popular unsupervised methods for constructing relation vectors. First, Diff uses the vector difference wk−wi, following the common strategy of modeling relations as vector differences, as e.g. in ( Vylomova et al., 2016 ). Second, Conc uses the concatenation ofwi andwk. This model is more general than Diff but it uses twice as many dimensions, which may make it harder to learn a good classifier from few examples. The use of concatenations is popular e.g. in the context of hypernym detection ( Baroni et al., 2012 ). Finally, Avg averages the vector representations of the words occurring in sentences that Diff, contain i and k.",

Among others, this task was considered in ( Vylomova et al., 2016 ), and a ranking version of this task was studied in ( Drozd et al., 2016 ). As test sets we use the Google Analogy Test Set ( Mikolov et al . , 2013a ) , which contains instances of 14 different types of relations , and the DiffVec dataset , which was introduced in ( Vylomova et al . , 2016 ) . This dataset contains instances of 36 different types of relations4. Note that both datasets contain a mix of semantic and syntactic relations. In our evaluation , we have used 10 - fold cross-validation ( or leave-one-out for relations with fewer than 10 instances ) .

For example, for the relation “X characteristically makes the sound Y ”, the pair ( dog,bark ) should be considered more prototypical than the pair ( floor,squeak ), even though both pairs might be considered to be instances of the relation ( Jurgens et al., 2012 ). A suitable relation vector should allow us to rank word pairs according to how prototypical they are as instances of that relation. We evaluate this ability using a dataset that was produced in the aftermath of SemEval 2012 Task 2 . In particular , we have used the “ Phase2AnswerScaled ” data from the platinum rankings dataset , which is available from the SemEval 2012 Task 2 website5 . In this dataset, 79 ranked list of word pairs are provided, each of which corresponds to a particular relation. For each relation, we first split the associated ranking into 60% training, 20% tuning, and 20% testing ( i.e. we randomly select 60% of the word pairs and use their ranking as training data, and similar for tuning and test data ). We then train a linear SVM regression model on the ranked word pairs . Note that this task slightly differs from the task that was considered at SemEval 2012 , to allow us to use an SVM based model for consistency with the rest of the paper .

Note that the Diff representations were found to achieve near state-of-the-art performance on a closely related task in ( Zhila et al., 2013 ). The only model that was found to perform ( slightly ) better was a hybrid model, combining Diff representations with linguistic patterns ( inspired by ( Rink and Harabagiu, 2012 ) ) and lexical databases, among others. 5.3 Relation Extraction Finally, we consider the problem of relation extraction from a text corpus. Specifically , we consider the task proposed in ( Riedel et al . , 2010 ) , which is to extract ( subject , predicate , object ) triples from the New York Times ( NYT ) corpus . Rather than having labelled sentences as training data , the task requires using the existing triples from Freebase as a form of distant supervision , i.e . for some pairs of entities we know some of the relations that hold between them , but not which sentences assert these relationships ( if any ) . To be consistent with published results for this task , we have used a word embedding that was trained from the NYT corpus6 , rather than Wikipedia ( using the same preprocessing and set-up ) . We have used the training and test data that was shared publicly for this task7, which consist of sentences from articles published in 2005-2006 and in 2007, respectively. Each of these sentences contains two entities , which are already linked to Freebase .",

After the optimal parameters have been determined, we retrain the model on the full training data, and apply it on the test fold. We used this approach ( rather than e.g. fixing a train/tune/test split ) because the total number of examples for some of the relations is very small. After tuning , we re-train the SVM models on the full training data . As the number of training examples is larger for this task , we also consider SVMs with a quadratic kernel . Following earlier work on this task , we report our results on the test set as a precisionrecall graph in Figure 1 .

A comparison with these models9 is shown in Figure 2. The performance of R2ik is comparable with the state-of-the-art PCNN + ATT model ( Lin et al . , 2016 ) , outperforming it for larger recall values . This is remarkable, as our model is conceptually much simpler, and has not been specifically tuned for this task. For instance , it could easily be improved by incorporating the attention mechanism from the PCNN + ATT model to focus the relation vectors on the considered task . Similarly, we could consider a supervised variant of ( 3 ), in which a learned relation-specific weight is added to each term. 6 Conclusions We have proposed an unsupervised method which uses co-occurrences statistics to represent the relationship between a given pair of words as a vector. In contrast to neural network models for relation extraction, our model learns relation vectors in an unsupervised way, which means that it can be used for measuring relational similarities and related tasks. Moreover, even in ( distantly ) supervised tasks ( where we need to learn a classifier on top of the unsupervised relation vectors ), our model has proven competitive with state-of-the-art neural network models.",

        "input": "The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Recent Advances in Neural Machine Translation Abstract The past year has witnessed rapid advances in sequence-to-sequence ( seq2seq ) modeling for Machine Translation ( MT ) . The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model , which was then outperformed by the more recent Transformer model . Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures . In this paper, we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First , we identify several key modeling and training techniques , and apply them to the RNN architecture , yielding a new RNMT + model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT ’ 14 English → French and English → German tasks . Second, we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seq architecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths. Our hybrid models obtain further improvements , outperforming the RNMT + model on both benchmark datasets . 1 Introduction In recent years , the emergence of seq2seq models ( Kalchbrenner and Blunsom , 2013 ; Sutskever et al . , 2014 ; Cho et al . , 2014 ) has revolutionized the field of MT by replacing traditional phrase-based approaches with neural machine translation ( NMT ) systems based on the encoder-decoder paradigm . In the first architectures that surpassed the quality of phrase-based MT , both the encoder and decoder were implemented as Recurrent Neural Networks ( RNNs ) , interacting via a soft-attention mechanism ( Bahdanau et al . , 2015 ) . The RNN-based NMT approach , or RNMT , was quickly established as the de-facto standard for NMT , and gained rapid adoption into large-scale systems in industry , e.g . Baidu ( Zhou et al . , 2016 ) , Google ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) , and Systran ( Crego et al . , 2016 ) .",

Well known examples are ByteNet ( Kalchbrenner et al . , 2016 ) and ConvS2S ( Gehring et al . , 2017 ) . The ConvS2S model was shown to outperform the original RNMT architecture in terms of quality , while also providing greater training speed . Most recently , the Transformer model ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) , which is based solely on a selfattention mechanism ( Parikh et al . , 2016 ) and feed-forward connections , has further advanced the field of NMT , both in terms of translation quality and speed of convergence . In many instances, new architectures are accompanied by a novel set of techniques for performing training and inference that have been carefully optimized to work in concert. This ‘bag of tricks’ can be crucial to the performance of a proposed architecture, yet it is typically under-documented and left for the enterprising researcher to discover in publicly released code ( if any ) or through anecdotal evidence. This is not simply a problem for reproducibility; it obscures the central scientific question of how much of the observed gains come from the new architecture and how much can be attributed to the associated training and inference techniques. In some cases, these new techniques may be broadly applicable to other architectures and thus constitute a major, though implicit, contribution of an architecture paper. Clearly, they need to be considered in order to ensure a fair comparison across different model architectures.

In ( Denkowski and Neubig, 2017 ) the authors recommend three specific techniques for strengthening NMT systems and empirically demonstrated how incorporating those techniques improves the reliability of the experimental results. 2 Background In this section, we briefly discuss the commmonly used NMT architectures. 2.1 RNN-based NMT Models - RNMT RNMT models are composed of an encoder RNN and a decoder RNN , coupled with an attention network . The encoder summarizes the input sequence into a set of vectors while the decoder conditions on the encoded input sequence through an attention mechanism, and generates the output sequence one token at a time. The most successful RNMT models consist of stacked RNN encoders with one or more bidirectional RNNs ( Schuster and Paliwal , 1997 ; Graves and Schmidhuber , 2005 ) , and stacked decoders with unidirectional RNNs . Both encoder and decoder RNNs consist of either LSTM ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ; Gers et al . , 2000 ) or GRU units ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) , and make extensive use of residual ( He et al . , 2015 ) or highway ( Srivastava et al . , 2015 ) connections . In Google-NMT ( GNMT ) ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) , the best performing RNMT model on the datasets we consider , the encoder network consists of one bi-directional LSTM layer , followed by 7 uni-directional LSTM layers . The decoder is equipped with a single attention network and 8 uni-directional LSTM layers . Both the encoder and the decoder use residual skip connections between consecutive layers. In this paper , we adopt GNMT as the starting point for our proposed RNMT + architecture . 2.2 Convolutional NMT Models - ConvS2S In the most successful convolutional sequence-to-sequence model ( Gehring et al . , 2017 ) , both the encoder and decoder are constructed by stacking multiple convolutional layers , where each layer contains 1 - dimensional convolutions followed by a gated linear units ( GLU ) ( Dauphin et al . , 2016 ) . Each decoder layer computes a separate dotproduct attention by using the current decoder layer output and the final encoder layer outputs.",

We follow the public ConvS2S codebase1 in our experiments . 2.3 Conditional Transformation-based NMT Models - Transformer The Transformer model ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) is motivated by two major design choices that aim to address deficiencies in the former two model families : ( 1 ) Unlike RNMT , but similar to the ConvS2S , the Transformer model avoids any sequential dependencies in both the encoder and decoder networks to maximally parallelize training . ( 2 ) To address the limited context problem ( limited receptive field ) present in ConvS2S , the Transformer model makes pervasive use of selfattention networks ( Parikh et al . , 2016 ) so that each position in the current layer has access to information from all other positions in the previous layer . The Transformer model still follows the encoder-decoder paradigm . Encoder transformer layers are built with two sub-modules: ( 1 ) a selfattention network and ( 2 ) a feed-forward network. Decoder transformer layers have an additional cross-attention layer sandwiched between the selfattention and feed-forward layers to attend to the encoder outputs. There are two details which we found very important to the model’s performance: ( 1 ) Each sublayer in the transformer ( i.e. self-attention, cross-attention, and the feed-forward sub-layer ) follows a strict computation sequence: normalize→ transform→ dropout→ residual-add. ( 2 ) In addition to per-layer normalization, the final encoder output is again normalized to prevent a blow up after consecutive residual additions. In this paper , we follow the latest version of the Transformer model in the Tensor2Tensor2 codebase . 2.4 A Theory-Based Characterization of NMT Architectures From a theoretical point of view, RNNs belong to the most expressive members of the neural network family ( Siegelmann and Sontag, 1995 )3. Possessing an infinite Markovian structure ( and thus an infinite receptive fields ) equips them to model sequential data ( Elman, 1990 ), especially natural language ( Grefenstette et al., 2015 ) effectively.",

Convolutional layers are adept at capturing local context and local correlations by design. A fixed and narrow receptive field for each convolutional layer limits their capacity when the architecture is shallow. In practice , this weakness is mitigated by stacking more convolutional layers ( e.g . 15 layers as in the ConvS2S model ) , which makes the model harder to train and demands meticulous initialization schemes and carefully designed regularization techniques . The transformer network is capable of approximating arbitrary squashing functions ( Hornik et al., 1989 ), and can be considered a strong feature extractor with extended receptive fields capable of linking salient features from the entire sequence. On the other hand , lacking a memory component ( as present in the RNN models ) prevents the network from modeling a state space , reducing its theoretical strength as a sequence model , thus it requires additional positional information ( e.g . sinusoidal positional encodings ) . Above theoretical characterizations will drive our explorations in the following sections. 3 Experiment Setup We train our models on the standard WMT ’ 14 En → Fr and En → De datasets that comprise 36.3M and 4.5M sentence pairs , respectively . Each sentence was encoded into a sequence of sub-word units obtained by first tokenizing the sentence with the Moses tokenizer, then splitting tokens into subword units ( also known as “wordpieces” ) using the approach described in ( Schuster and Nakajima, 2012 ). We use a shared vocabulary of 32K sub-word units for each source-target language pair. No further manual or rule-based post processing of the output was performed beyond combining the subword units to generate the targets.",

        "input": "Weight Decay : For the WMT ’ 14 En → De task , we apply L2 regularization to the weights with λ = 10 − 5 . Weight decay is only applied to the En→De task as the corpus is smaller and thus more regularization is required. We use the Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) with β1 = 0.9 , β2 = 0.999 , \u000f = 10 − 6 and vary the learning rate according to this schedule : Here, t is the current step, n is the number of concurrent model replicas used in training, p is the number of warmup steps, s is the start step of the exponential decay, and e is the end step of the decay. Specifically, we first increase the learning rate linearly during the number of warmup steps, keep it a constant until the decay start step s, then exponentially decay until the decay end step e, and keep it at 5 · 10−5 after the decay ends. This learning rate schedule is motivated by a similar schedule that was successfully applied in training the Resnet - 50 model with a very large batch size ( Goyal et al . , 2017 ) . In contrast to the asynchronous training used for GNMT ( Dean et al . , 2012 ) , we train RNMT + models with synchronous training ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) . Our empirical results suggest that when hyper-parameters are tuned properly, synchronous training often leads to improved convergence speed and superior model quality. To further stabilize training, we also use adaptive gradient clipping. We discard a training step completely if an anomaly in the gradient norm value is detected, which is usually an indication of an imminent gradient explosion. More specifically, we keep track of a moving average and a moving standard deviation of the log of the gradient norm values, and we abort a step if the norm of the gradient exceeds four standard deviations of the moving average. 4.2 Model Analysis and Comparison In this section , we compare the results of RNMT + with ConvS2S and Transformer .",

Since by design, we remove one technique at a time in our ablation experiments, we were unable to quantify how much layer normalization helped in either case.

Synchronous training Removing synchronous training has different effects on RNMT + and Transformer . For RNMT + , it results in a significant quality drop , while for the Transformer Big model , it causes the model to become unstable . We also notice that synchronous training is only successful when coupled with a tailored learning rate schedule that has a warmup stage at the beginning ( cf . Eq . 1 for RNMT + and Eq . 2 for Transformer ) . For RNMT + , removing this warmup stage during synchronous training causes the model to become unstable . 6 Hybrid NMT Models In this section, we explore hybrid architectures that shed some light on the salient behavior of each model family. These hybrid models outperform the individual architectures on both benchmark datasets and provide a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of each model family. 6.1 Assessing Individual Encoders and Decoders In an encoder-decoder architecture, a natural assumption is that the role of an encoder is to build feature representations that can best encode the meaning of the source sequence, while a decoder should be able to process and interpret the representations from the encoder and, at the same time, track the current target history. Decoding is inherently auto-regressive, and keeping track of the state information should therefore be intuitively beneficial for conditional generation.",

        "input": "We set out to study which family of encoders is more suitable to extract rich representations from a given input sequence, and which family of decoders can make the best of such rich representations. We start by combining the encoder and decoder from different model families. Since it takes a significant amount of time for a ConvS2S model to converge , and because the final translation quality was not on par with the other models , we focus on two types of hybrids only : Transformer encoder with RNMT + decoder and RNMT + encoder with Transformer decoder . From Table 5 , it is clear that the Transformer encoder is better at encoding or feature extraction than the RNMT + encoder , whereas RNMT + is better at decoding or conditional language modeling , confirming our intuition that a stateful decoder is beneficial for conditional language generation . 6.2 Assessing Encoder Combinations Next, we explore how the features extracted by an encoder can be further enhanced by incorporating additional information. Specifically , we investigate the combination of transformer layers with RNMT + layers in the same encoder block to build even richer feature representations . We exclusively use RNMT + decoders in the following architectures since stateful decoders show better performance according to Table 5 . We study two mixing schemes in the encoder ( see Fig. 2 ): ( 1 ) Cascaded Encoder : The cascaded encoder aims at combining the representational power of RNNs and self-attention . The idea is to enrich a set of stateful representations by cascading a feature extractor with a focus on vertical mapping, similar to ( Pascanu et al., 2013; Devlin, 2017 ).

Unlike a cascaded encoder , the multi-column encoder enables us to investigate whether an RNMT + decoder can distinguish information received from two different channels and benefit from its combination . A crucial operation in a multi-column encoder is therefore how different sources of information are merged into a unified representation. Our best multi-column encoder performs a simple concatenation of individual column outputs. The model details and hyperparameters of the above two encoders are described in Appendix A.5 and A.6. As shown in Table 6 , the multi-column encoder followed by an RNMT + decoder achieves better results than the Transformer and the RNMT model on both WMT ’ 14 benchmark tasks . 7 Conclusion In this work we explored the efficacy of several architectural and training techniques proposed in recent studies on seq2seq models for NMT . We demonstrated that many of these techniques are broadly applicable to multiple model architectures.

        "input": "However , as reported in many studies ( Koehn and Knowles , 2017 ) , the performance of a seq2seq model deteriorates quickly with the increase of the length of generation . Our experiments also show that seq2seq models tend to “ lose control ” sometimes . For example, 3% of summaries contain less than 3 words, while there are 4 summaries repeating a word for even 99 times. These results largely reduce the informativeness and readability of the generated summaries. In addition , we find seq2seq models usually focus on copying source words in order , without any actual “ summarization ” . Therefore , we argue that , the free generation based on the source sentence is not enough for a seq2seq model . Template based summarization ( e.g . , Zhou and Hovy ( 2004 ) ) is a traditional approach to abstractive summarization . In general, a template is an incomplete sentence which can be filled with the input text using the manually defined rules. For instance, a concise template to conclude the stock market quotation is: [REGION] shares [open/close] [NUMBER] percent [lower/higher], e.g., “hong kong shares close #.# percent lower”. Since the templates are written by humans, the produced summaries are usually fluent and informative.",

We call these existing summaries soft templates since no actual rules are needed to build new summaries from them. Due to the strong rewriting ability of the seq2seq framework ( Cao et al . , 2017a ) , in this paper , we propose to combine the seq2seq and template based summarization approaches . We call our summarization system Re3Sum , which consists of three modules : Retrieve , Rerank and Rewrite . We utilize a widely-used Information Retrieval ( IR ) platform to find out candidate soft templates from the training corpus. Then , we extend the seq2seq model to jointly learn template saliency measurement ( Rerank ) and final summary generation ( Rewrite ) .

Considering that the matching networks based on hidden states have demonstrated the strong ability to measure the relevance of two pieces of texts ( e.g., Chen et al. ( 2016 ) ), we propose to jointly conduct reranking and rewriting through a shared encoding step. Specifically , we employ a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network ( BiRNN ) encoder ( Cho et al . , 2014 ) to read x and r . Take the sentence x as an example. Its hidden state of the forward RNN at timestamp i can be represented by : The BiRNN consists of a forward RNN and a backward RNN . Suppose the corresponding outputs are [ −→ h x1 ; · · · ; −→ h x−1] and [ ←− h x1 ; · · · ; ←− h x−1], respectively, where the index “−1” stands for the last element. Then , the composite hidden state of a word is the concatenation of the two RNN representations , i.e . , hxi = [ − → h xi ; ← − h xi ] . The entire representation for the source sentence is [hx1 ; · · · ;hx−1]. Since a soft template r can also be regarded as a readable concise sentence , we use the same BiRNN encoder to convert it into hidden states [ hr1 ; · · · ; hr − 1 ] . 2.2.1 Rerank In Retrieve, the template candidates are ranked according to the text similarity between the corresponding indexed sentences and the input sentence. However, for the summarization task, we expect the soft template r resembles the actual summary y∗ as much as possible.",

We utilize the hidden states of x and r to predict the saliency s of the template. Specifically , we regard the output of the BiRNN as the representation of the sentence or template : Next , we use Bilinear network to predict the saliency of the template for the input sentence . where Ws and bs are parameters of the Bilinear network , and we add the sigmoid activation function to make the range of s consistent with the actual saliency s ∗ . According to Chen et al . ( 2016 ) , Bilinear outperforms multi-layer forward neural networks in relevance measurement . As shown later , the difference of s and s ∗ will provide additional supervisions for the seq2seq framework . 2.2.2 Rewrite The soft template r selected by the Rerank module has already competed with the state-of-the-art method in terms of ROUGE evaluation ( see Table 4 ) . However, r usually contains a lot of named entities that does not appear in the source ( see Table 5 ). Consequently, it is hard to ensure that the soft templates are faithful to the input sentences. Therefore , we leverage the strong rewriting ability of the seq2seq model to generate more faithful and informative summaries . Specifically, since the input of our system consists of both the sentence and soft template, we use the concatenation function3 to combine the hidden states of the sentence and The combined hidden states are fed into the prevailing attentional RNN decoder ( Bahdanau et al . , 2014 ) to generate the decoding hidden state at the position t : where yt − 1 is the previous output summary word .

        "input": "STRUCTVAE: Tree-structured Latent Variable Models for Semi-supervised Semantic Parsing Abstract Semantic parsing is the task of transducing natural language ( NL ) utterances into formal meaning representations ( MRs ), commonly represented as tree structures. Annotating NL utterances with their corresponding MRs is expensive and timeconsuming, and thus the limited availability of labeled data often becomes the bottleneck of data-driven, supervised models. We introduce STRUCTVAE , a variational auto-encoding model for semisupervised semantic parsing , which learns both from limited amounts of parallel data , and readily-available unlabeled NL utterances . STRUCTVAE models latent MRs not observed in the unlabeled data as tree-structured latent variables . Experiments on semantic parsing on the ATIS domain and Python code generation show that with extra unlabeled data , STRUCTVAE outperforms strong supervised models .1 1 Introduction Semantic parsing tackles the task of mapping natural language ( NL ) utterances into structured formal meaning representations ( MRs ). This includes parsing to general-purpose logical forms such as λ-calculus ( Zettlemoyer and Collins , 2005 , 2007 ) and the abstract meaning representation ( AMR , Banarescu et al . ( 2013 ) ; Misra and Artzi ( 2016 ) ) , as well as parsing to computerexecutable programs to solve problems such as question answering ( Berant et al . , 2013 ; Yih et al . , 2015 ; Liang et al . , 2017 ) , or generation of domainspecific ( e.g . , SQL ) or general purpose programming languages ( e.g . , Python ) ( Quirk et al . , 2015 ; Yin and Neubig , 2017 ; Rabinovich et al . , 2017 ) . While these models have a long history ( Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001 ), recent advances are largely attributed to the success of neural network models ( Xiao et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2016; Dong and Lapata, 2016; Iyer et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2017 ). However, these models are also extremely data hungry: optimization of such models requires large amounts of training data of parallel NL utterances and manually annotated MRs, the creation of which can be expensive, cumbersome, and time-consuming. Therefore, the limited availability of parallel data has become the bottleneck of existing, purely supervised-based models. These data requirements can be alleviated with weakly-supervised learning, where the denotations ( e.g., answers in question answering ) of MRs ( e.g., logical form queries ) are used as indirect supervision ( Clarke et al. ( 2010 ); Liang et al. ( 2011 ); Berant et al. ( 2013 ), inter alia ), or dataaugmentation techniques that automatically generate pseudo-parallel corpora using hand-crafted or induced grammars ( Jia and Liang, 2016; Wang et al., 2015 ).",

        "input": "In this work , we focus on semi-supervised learning , aiming to learn from both limited amounts of parallel NL-MR corpora , and unlabeled but readily-available NL utterances . We draw inspiration from recent success in applying variational auto-encoding ( VAE ) models in semisupervised sequence-to-sequence learning ( Miao and Blunsom , 2016 ; Kocisky ´ et al . , 2016 ) , and propose STRUCTVAE — a principled deep generative approach for semi-supervised learning with tree-structured latent variables ( Fig . 1 ) . STRUCTVAE is based on a generative story where the surface NL utterances are generated from tree-structured latent MRs following the standard VAE architecture : ( 1 ) an off-the-shelf semantic parser functions as the inference model, parsing an observed NL utterance into latent meaning representations ( § 3.2 ); ( 2 ) a reconstruction model decodes the latent MR into the original observed utterance ( § 3.1 ). This formulation enables our model to perform both standard supervised learning by optimizing the inference model ( i.e., the parser ) using parallel corpora, and unsupervised learning by maximizing the variational lower bound of the likelihood of the unlabeled utterances ( § 3.3 ). In addition to these contributions to semisupervised semantic parsing , STRUCTVAE contributes to generative model research as a whole , providing a recipe for training VAEs with structured latent variables . Such a structural latent space is contrast to existing VAE research using flat representations , such as continuous distributed representations ( Kingma and Welling , 2013 ) , discrete symbols ( Miao and Blunsom , 2016 ) , or hybrids of the two ( Zhou and Neubig , 2017 ) . We apply STRUCTVAE to semantic parsing on the ATIS domain and Python code generation . As an auxiliary contribution , we implement a transition-based semantic parser , which uses Abstract Syntax Trees ( ASTs , § 3.2 ) as intermediate MRs and achieves strong results on the two tasks . We then apply this parser as the inference model for semi-supervised learning , and show that with extra unlabeled data , STRUCTVAE outperforms its supervised counterpart . We also demonstrate that STRUCTVAE is compatible with different structured latent representations , applying it to a simple sequence-to-sequence parser which uses λ-calculus logical forms as MRs . 2 Semi-supervised Semantic Parsing In this section we introduce the objectives for semi-supervised semantic parsing , and present high-level intuition in applying VAEs for this task . 2.1 Supervised and Semi-supervised Training Formally, semantic parsing is the task of mapping utterance x to a meaning representation z.",

        "input": "As noted above, there are many varieties of MRs that can be represented as either graph structures ( e.g., AMR ) or tree structures ( e.g., λ-calculus and ASTs for programming languages ). In this work we specifically focus on tree-structured MRs ( see Fig. 2 for a running example Python AST ), although application of a similar framework to graph-structured representations is also feasible. Traditionally, purely supervised semantic parsers train a probabilistic model pφ( z|x ) using parallel data L of NL utterances and annotated MRs ( i.e., L = {〈x, z〉} ). As noted in the introduction, one major bottleneck in this approach is the lack of such parallel data. Hence, we turn to semi-supervised learning, where the model additionally has access to a relatively large amount of unlabeled NL utterances U = {x}. Semi-supervised learning then aims to maximize the log-likelihood of examples in both L and U: The joint objective consists of two terms: ( 1 ) a supervised objective Js that maximizes the conditional likelihood of annotated MRs, as in standard supervised training of semantic parsers; and ( 2 ) a unsupervised objective Ju, which maximizes the marginal likelihood p( x ) of unlabeled NL utterances U, controlled by a tuning parameter α. Intuitively, if the modeling of pφ( z|x ) and p( x ) is coupled ( e.g., they share parameters ), then optimizing the marginal likelihood p( x ) using the unsupervised objective Ju would help the learning of the semantic parser pφ( z|x ) ( Zhu, 2005 ). STRUCTVAE uses the variational auto-encoding framework to jointly optimize pφ ( z | x ) and p ( x ) , as outlined in § 2.2 and detailed in § 3 . 2.2 VAEs for Semi-supervised Learning From Eq. ( 1 ), our semi-supervised model must be able to calculate the probability p( x ) of unlabeled NL utterances. To model p ( x ) , we use VAEs , which provide a principled framework for generative models using neural networks ( Kingma and Welling , 2013 ) . As shown in Fig . 1 , VAEs define a generative story ( bold arrows in Fig . 1 , explained in § 3.1 ) to model p ( x ) , where a latent MR z is sampled from a prior , and then passed to the reconstruction model to decode into the surface utterance x .",

        "input": "There is also an inference model qφ( z|x ) that allows us to infer the most probable latent MR z given the input x ( dashed arrows in Fig. 1, explained in § 3.2 ). In our case, the inference process is equivalent to the task of semantic parsing if we set qφ( · ) , pφ( · ). VAEs also provide a framework to compute an approximation of p ( x ) using the inference and reconstruction models , allowing us to effectively optimize the unsupervised and supervised objectives in Eq . ( 1 ) in a joint fashion ( Kingma et al . ( 2014 ) , explained in § 3.3 ) . 3 STRUCTVAE: VAEs with Tree-structured Latent Variables 3.1 Generative Story STRUCTVAE follows the standard VAE architecture , and defines a generative story that explains how an NL utterance is generated : a latent meaning representation z is sampled from a prior distribution p ( z ) over MRs , which encodes the latent semantics of the utterance . A reconstruction model pθ( x|z ) then decodes the sampled MR z into the observed NL utterance x. Both the prior p( z ) and the reconstruction model p( x|z ) takes tree-structured MRs as inputs. To model such inputs with rich internal structures, we follow Konstas et al. ( 2017 ), and model the distribution over a sequential surface representation of z, zs instead. Specifically, we have p( z ) , p( zs ) and pθ( x|z ) , pθ( x|zs )2. For code generation, zs is simply the surface source code of the AST z. For semantic parsing, zs is the linearized s-expression of the logical form. Linearization allows us to use standard sequence-to-sequence networks to model p ( z ) and pθ ( x | z ) .",

        "input": "As we will explain in § 4.3, we find these two components perform well with linearization.

The reconstruction model is an attentional sequence-to-sequence network ( Luong et al . , 2015 ) , augmented with a copying mechanism ( Gu et al . , 2016 ) , allowing an out-of-vocabulary ( OOV ) entity in zs to be copied to x ( e.g . , the variable name my list in Fig . 1 and its AST in Fig . 2 ) . We refer readers to Appendix B for details of the neural network architecture. 3.2 Inference Model STRUCTVAE models the semantic parser pφ ( z | x ) as the inference model qφ ( z | x ) in VAE ( § 2.2 ) , which maps NL utterances x into tree-structured meaning representations z . qφ ( z | x ) can be any trainable semantic parser , with the corresponding MRs forming the structured latent semantic space . In this work , we primarily use a semantic parser based on the Abstract Syntax Description Language ( ASDL ) framework ( Wang et al . , 1997 ) as the inference model . The parser encodes x into ASTs ( Fig. 2 ). ASTs are the native meaning representation scheme of source code in modern programming languages, and can also be adapted to represent other semantic structures, like λ-calculus logical forms ( see § 4.2 for details ). We remark that STRUCTVAE works with other semantic parsers with different meaning representations as well ( e.g . , using λ-calculus logical forms for semantic parsing on ATIS , explained in § 4.3 ) . Our inference model is a transition-based parser inspired by recent work in neural semantic parsing and code generation. The transition system is an adaptation of Yin and Neubig ( 2017 ) ( hereafter YN17 ) , which decomposes the generation process of an AST into sequential applications of tree-construction actions following the ASDL grammar , thus ensuring the syntactic well-formedness of generated ASTs .",

An AST can be generated by applying typed constructors in an ASDL grammar , such as those in Fig . 3 for the Python ASDL grammar . Each constructor specifies a language construct, and is assigned to a particular composite type. For example, the constructor Call has type expr ( expression ), and it denotes function calls. Constructors are associated with multiple fields. For instance, the Call constructor and has three fields: func, args and keywords. Like constructors, fields are also strongly typed. For example, the func field of Call has expr type. Fields with composite types are instantiated by constructors of the same type, while fields with primitive types store values ( e.g., identifier names or string literals ).

For instance, the func field in the example AST has single cardinality, and is instantiated with a Name constructor; while the args field with sequential cardinality could have multi-ple constructors ( only one shown in this example ). Our parser employs a transition system to generate an AST using three types of actions. Fig. 2 ( Right ) lists the sequence of actions used to generate the example AST. The generation process starts from an initial derivation with only a root node of type stmt ( statement ), and proceeds according to the top-down, left-to-right traversal of the AST. At each time step, the parser applies an action to the frontier field of the derivation: APPLYCONSTR[c] actions apply a constructor c to the frontier composite field, expanding the derivation using the fields of c. For fields with single or optional cardinality, an APPLYCONSTR action instantiates the empty frontier field using the constructor, while for fields with sequential cardinality, it appends the constructor to the frontier field. For example, at t2 the Call constructor is applied to the value field of Expr, and the derivation is expanded using its three child fields.

The learning signal weights the gradient for each latent sample z. In REIN-FORCE, to cope with the high variance of the learning signal, it is common to use a baseline b( x ) to stabilize learning, and re-define the learning signal as Specifically , in STRUCTVAE , we define , where log p ( x ) is a pre-trained LSTM language model . This is motivated by the empirical observation that log p( x ) correlates well with the reconstruction score log pθ( x|z ), hence with l′( x, z ). Finally, for the reconstruction model, its gradient can be easily computed: Discussion .Perhaps the most intriguing question here is why semi-supervised learning could improve semantic parsing performance. While the underlying theoretical exposition still remains an active research problem ( Singh et al., 2008 ), in this paper we try to empirically test some likely hypotheses. In Eq. ( 4 ), the gradient received by the inference model from each latent sample z is weighed by the learning signal l( x, z ). l ( x , z ) can be viewed as the reward function in REINFORCE learning . It can also be viewed as weights associated with pseudo-training examples {〈x, z〉 : z ∈ S( x )} sampled from the inference model. Intuitively, a sample z with higher rewards should: ( 1 ) have z adequately encode the input, leading to high reconstruction score log pθ( x|z ); and ( 2 ) have z be succinct and natural, yielding high prior probability.",

Consider the ideal case where z∗ ∈ S( x ) and l( x, z∗ ) is positive, while l( x, z′ ) is negative for other imperfect samples z′ ∈ S( x ), z′ 6= z∗. In this ideal case, 〈x, z∗〉would serve as a positive training example and other samples 〈x, z′〉 would be treated as negative examples. Therefore, the inference model would receive informative gradient updates, and learn to discriminate between gold and imperfect MRs.

First , comparing our proposed STRUCTVAE with the supervised parser when there are extra unlabeled data ( i.e . , | L | < 4 , 434 for ATIS and | L | < 16 , 000 for DJANGO ) , semi-supervised learning with STRUCTVAE consistently achieves better performance . Notably , on DJANGO , our model registers results as competitive as previous state-of-the-art method ( YN17 ) using only half the training data ( 71.5 when | L | = 8000 v.s . 71.6 for YN17 ) . This demonstrates that STRUCTVAE is capable of learning from unlabeled NL utterances by inferring high quality , structurally rich latent meaning representations , further improving the performance of its supervised counterpart that is already competitive . Second , comparing STRUCTVAE with self-training , we find STRUCTVAE outperforms SELFTRAIN in eight out of ten settings , while SELFTRAIN under-performs the supervised parser in four out of ten settings . This shows self-training does not necessarily yield stable gains while STRUCTVAE does . Intuitively , STRUCTVAE would perform better since it benefits from the additional signal of the quality of MRs from the reconstruction model ( § 3.3 ) , for which we present more analysis in our next set of experiments . For the sake of completeness , we also report the results of STRUCTVAE when L is the full training set . Note that in this scenario there is no extra unlabeled data disjoint with the labeled set , and not surprisingly , STRUCTVAE does not outperform the supervised parser .

Study of Learning Signals .As discussed in § 3.3, in semi-supervised learning, the gradient received by the inference model from each sampled latent MR is weighted by the learning signal. Empirically, we would expect that on average, the learning signals of gold-standard samples z∗, l( x, z∗ ), are positive, larger than those of other ( imperfect ) samples z′, l( x, z′ ). We therefore study the statistics of l( x, z∗ ) and l( x, z′ ) for all utterances x ∈ U − L, i.e., the set of utterances which are not included in the labeled set.5 The statistics are obtained by performing inference using trained models. Figures 4a and 4b depict the histograms of learning signals on DJANGO and ATIS , resp . We observe that the learning signals for gold samples concentrate on positive intervals. We also show the mean and variance of the learning signals. On average, we have l( x, z∗ ) being positive and l( x, z ) negative.

Examples 1&2 show that the reconstruction score serves as an informative quality measure of the latent MR, assigning the correct samples zs1 with high log p( x|z ), leading to positive learning signals. This is in line with our assumption that a good latent MR should adequately encode the semantics of the utterance. Example 3 shows that the prior is also effective in identifying “unnatural” MRs ( e.g., it is rare to add a function and a string literal, as in zs2 ). These results also suggest that the prior and the reconstruction model perform well with linearization of MRs.

In § 3.3 we discussed our design of the baseline function b( x ) incorporated in the learning signal ( Eq. ( 4 ) ) to stabilize learning, which is based on a language model ( LM ) over utterances ( Eq. ( 6 ) ). We compare this baseline with a commonly used one in REINFORCE training : the multi-layer perceptron ( MLP ) . The MLP takes as input the last hidden state of the utterance given by the encoding LSTM of the inference model . Tab. 5 lists the results over sampled settings. We found that although STRUCTVAE with the MLP baseline sometimes registers better performance on ATIS , in most settings it is worse than our LM baseline , and could be even worse than the supervised parser . On the other hand, our LM baseline correlates well with the learning signal, yielding stable improvements over the supervised parser.

        "input": "Generating Logical Forms from Graph Representations of Text and Entities Abstract Structured information about entities is critical for many semantic parsing tasks. We present an approach that uses a Graph Neural Network ( GNN ) architecture to incorporate information about relevant entities and their relations during parsing . Combined with a decoder copy mechanism , this approach provides a conceptually simple mechanism to generate logical forms with entities . We demonstrate that this approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art across several tasks without pretraining , and outperforms existing approaches when combined with BERT pre-training . 1 Introduction Semantic parsing maps natural language utterances into structured meaning representations. The representation languages vary between tasks, but typically provide a precise, machine interpretable logical form suitable for applications such as question answering ( Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Liang et al., 2013; Berant et al., 2013 ). The logical forms typically consist of two types of symbols: a vocabulary of operators and domain-specific predicates or functions, and entities grounded to some knowledge base or domain. Recent approaches to semantic parsing have cast it as a sequence-to-sequence task ( Dong and Lapata, 2016; Jia and Liang, 2016; Ling et al., 2016 ), employing methods similar to those developed for neural machine translation ( Bahdanau et al., 2014 ), with strong results. However, special consideration is typically given to handling of entities. This is important to improve generalization and computational efficiency, as most tasks require handling entities unseen during training, and the set of unique entities can be large. Some recent approaches have replaced surface forms of entities in the utterance with placeholders ( Dong and Lapata, 2016 ).",

        "input": "This requires a preprocessing step to completely disambiguate entities and replace their spans in the utterance. Additionally, for some tasks it may be beneficial to leverage relations between entities, multiple entity candidates per span, or entity candidates without a corresponding span in the utterance, while generating logical forms. Other approaches identify only types and surface forms of entities while constructing the logical form ( Jia and Liang, 2016 ), using a separate post-processing step to generate the final logical form with grounded entities. This ignores potentially useful knowledge about relevant entities. Meanwhile , there has been considerable recent interest in Graph Neural Networks ( GNNs ) ( Scarselli et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2016 ; Kipf and Welling , 2017 ; Gilmer et al . , 2017 ; Velicˇkovic ´ et al . , 2018 ) for effectively learning representations for graph structures . We propose a GNN architecture based on extending the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) to make use of relations between input elements . We present an application of this GNN architecture to semantic parsing , conditioning on a graph representation of the given natural language utterance and potentially relevant entities . This approach is capable of handling ambiguous and potentially conflicting entity candidates jointly with a natural language utterance, relaxing the need for completely disambiguating a set of linked entities before parsing. This graph formulation also enables us to incorporate knowledge about the relations between entities where available. Combined with a copy mechanism while decoding , this approach also provides a conceptually simple method for generating logical forms with grounded entities .",

Further improvements are possible by incorporating a pretrained BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) encoder within the architecture . 2 Task Formulation Our goal is to learn a model for semantic parsing from pairs of natural language utterances and structured meaning representations. Let the natural language utterance be represented as a sequence x = ( x1, . . . , x|x| ) of |x| tokens, and the meaning representation be represented as a sequence y = ( y1, . . . , y|y| ) of |y| elements. The goal is to estimate p( y | x ), the conditional probability of the meaning representation y given utterance x, which is augmented by a set of potentially relevant entities. Input Utterance Each token xi ∈ V in is from a vocabulary of input tokens. Entity Candidates Given the input utterance x, we retrieve a set, e = {e1, . . . , e|e|}, of potentially relevant entity candidates, with e ⊆ Ve, where Ve is in the set of all entities for a given domain. We assume the availability of an entity candidate generator for each task to generate e given x, with details given in § 5.2. For each entity candidate, e ∈ Ve, we require a set of task-specific attributes containing one or more elements from Va. These attributes can be NER types or other characteristics of the entity, such as “city” or “river” for some of the entities listed in Table 1. Whereas Ve can be quite large for open domains, or even infinite if it includes sets such as the natural numbers, Va is typically much smaller.",

        "input": "Therefore, we can effectively learn representations for entities given their set of attributes, from our set of example pairs. Edge Labels In addition to x and e for a particular example, we also consider the ( |x|+|e| )2 pairwise relations between all tokens and entity candidates, represented as edge labels. The edge label between tokens xi and xj corresponds to the relative sequential position, j − i, of the tokens, clipped to within some range. The edge label between token xi and entity ej , and vice versa, corresponds to whether xi is within the span of the entity candidate ej , or not. The edge label between entities ei and ej captures the relationship between the entities. These edge labels can have domain-specific interpretations, such as relations in a knowledge base, or any other type of entity interaction features. For tasks where this information is not available or useful, a single generic label between entity candidates can be used. Output We consider the logical form, y, to be a linear sequence ( Vinyals et al., 2015b ). We tokenize based on the syntax of each domain.

The sub-layer maps an ordered sequence of node representations, u = ( u1, . . . , u|u| ), to a new sequence of node representations, u′ = ( u′1, . . . , u′|u| ), where each node is represented ∈ Rd. We use rij to denote the edge label corresponding to ui and uj . We implement this sub-layer in terms of a function f( m, l ) over a node representation m ∈ Rd and an edge label l that computes a vector representation in Rd′ . We use nheads parallel attention heads, with d′ = d/nheads. For each head k, the new representation for the node ui is computed by , where each coefficient αij is a softmax over the scaled dot products sij , and Wq is a learned matrix. Finally, we concatenate representations from each head, where Wh is another learned matrix and [ · · · ] denotes concatenation. If we implement f as , where Wr ∈ Rd ′ × d is a learned matrix , then the sub-layer would be effectively identical to self-attention as initially proposed in the Transformer ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) . We focus on two alternative formulations of f that represent edge labels as learned matrices and learned vectors.",

( 2018 ), where Wr ∈ Rd′×d is a learned matrix shared by all edge labels, and wl ∈ Rd is a learned embedding vector per edge label l. 3.2 Encoder Input Representations Before the initial encoder layer , tokens are mapped to initial representations using either a learned embedding table for V in , or the output of a pre-trained BERT ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) encoder . Entity candidates are mapped to initial representations using the mean of the embeddings for each of the entity’s attributes, based on a learned embedding table for Va. We also concatenate an embedding representing the node type, token or entity, to each input representation. We assume some arbitrary ordering for entity candidates, generating a combined sequence of initial node representations for tokens and entities. We have edge labels between every pair of nodes as described in § 2. Encoder Layers Our encoder layers are essentially identical to the Transformer , except with the proposed extension to self-attention to incorporate edge labels . Therefore, each encoder layer consists of two sub-layers. The first is the GNN sub-layer , which yields new sets of token and entity representations .

More recently , encoder-decoder architectures have been applied with strong results ( Dong and Lapata , 2016 ; Jia and Liang , 2016 ) . Even for tasks with relatively small domains of entities , such as GEO and ATIS , it has been shown that some special consideration of entities within an encoder-decoder architecture is important to improve generalization . This has included extending decoders with copy mechanisms ( Jia and Liang , 2016 ) and / or identifying entities in the input as a pre-processing step ( Dong and Lapata , 2016 ) . Other work has considered open domain tasks , such as WEBQUESTIONSSP ( Yih et al . , 2016 ) . Recent approaches have typically relied on a separate entity linking model , such as S-MART ( Yang and Chang , 2015 ) , to provide a single disambiguated set of entities to consider . In principle, a learned entity linker could also serve as an entity candidate generator within our framework, although we do not explore such tasks in this work. Considerable recent work has focused on constrained decoding of various forms within an encoder-decoder architecture to leverage the known structure of the logical forms .",

        "input": "This has led to approaches that leverage this structure during decoding, such as using tree decoders ( Dong and Lapata, 2016; Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola, 2017 ) or other mechanisms ( Dong and Lapata, 2018; Goldman et al., 2017 ). Other approaches use grammar rules to constrain decoding ( Xiao et al., 2016; Yin and Neubig, 2017; Krishnamurthy et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018b ). We leave investigation of such decoder constraints to future work. Many formulations of Graph Neural Networks ( GNNs ) that propagate information over local neighborhoods have recently been proposed ( Li et al . , 2016 ; Kipf and Welling , 2017 ; Gilmer et al . , 2017 ; Velicˇkovic ´ et al . , 2018 ) . Recent work has often focused on large graphs ( Hamilton et al., 2017 ) and effectively propagating information over multiple graph steps ( Xu et al., 2018 ). The graphs we consider are relatively small and are fullyconnected, avoiding some of the challenges posed by learning representations for large, sparsely connected graphs. Other recent work related to ours has considered GNNs for natural language tasks , such as combining structured and unstructured data for question answering ( Sun et al . , 2018 ) , or for representing dependencies in tasks such as AMR parsing and machine translation ( Beck et al . , 2018 ; Bastings et al . , 2017 ) . The approach of Krishnamurthy et al . ( 2017 ) similarly considers ambiguous entity mentions jointly with query tokens for semantic parsing , although does not directly consider a GNN . Previous work has interpreted the Transformer ’ s self-attention mechanism as a GNN ( Velicˇkovic ´ et al . , 2018 ; Battaglia et al . , 2018 ) , and extended it to consider relative positions as edge representations ( Shaw et al . , 2018 ) . Previous work has also similarly represented edge labels as vectors, as opposed to matrices, in order to avoid over-parameterizing the model ( Marcheggiani and Titov, 2017 ). 5 Experiments 5.1 Semantic Parsing Datasets We consider three semantic parsing datasets, with examples given in Table 1.",

        "input": "Augmenting Neural Networks with First-order Logic Abstract Today, the dominant paradigm for training neural networks involves minimizing task loss on a large dataset. Using world knowledge to inform a model, and yet retain the ability to perform end-to-end training remains an open question. In this paper, we present a novel framework for introducing declarative knowledge to neural network architectures in order to guide training and prediction. Our framework systematically compiles logical statements into computation graphs that augment a neural network without extra learnable parameters or manual redesign. We evaluate our modeling strategy on three tasks: machine comprehension, natural language inference, and text chunking. Our experiments show that knowledge-augmented networks can strongly improve over baselines, especially in low-data regimes. 1 Introduction Neural models demonstrate remarkable predictive performance across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks: e.g., natural language inference ( Parikh et al., 2016 ), machine comprehension ( Seo et al., 2017 ), machine translation ( Bahdanau et al., 2015 ), and summarization ( Rush et al., 2015 ). These successes can be attributed to their ability to learn robust representations from data. However, such end-to-end training demands a large number of training examples; for example, training a typical network for machine translation may require millions of sentence pairs ( e.g. Luong et al., 2015 ). The difficulties and expense of curating large amounts of annotated data are well understood and, consequently, massive datasets may not be available for new tasks, domains or languages.",

        "input": "In this paper, we argue that we can combat the data hungriness of neural networks by taking advantage of domain knowledge expressed as first-order logic. As an example, consider the task of reading comprehension, where the goal is to answer a question based on a paragraph of text ( Fig. 1 ). Attention-driven models such as BiDAF ( Seo et al . , 2017 ) learn to align words in the question with words in the text as an intermediate step towards identifying the answer . While alignments ( e.g . author to writing ) can be learned from data , we argue that models can reduce their data dependence if they were guided by easily stated rules such as : Prefer aligning phrases that are marked as similar according to an external resource , e.g . , ConceptNet ( Liu and Singh , 2004 ) . If such declaratively stated rules can be incorporated into training neural networks, then they can provide the inductive bias that can reduce data dependence for training. That general neural networks can represent such Boolean functions is known and has been studied both from the theoretical and empirical perspectives ( e.g. Maass et al., 1994; Anthony, 2003; Pan and Srikumar, 2016 ). Recently, Hu et al. ( 2016 ) exploit this property to train a neural network to mimic a teacher network that uses structured rules. In this paper, we seek to directly incorporate such structured knowledge into a neural network architecture without substantial changes to the training methods. We focus on three questions: 1.",

How does incorporating domain expertise compare against large training resources powered by pre-trained representations? The first question poses the key technical challenge we address in this paper. On one hand, we wish to guide training and prediction with neural networks using logic, which is non-differentiable. On the other hand, we seek to retain the advantages of gradient-based learning without having to redesign the training scheme. To this end, we propose a framework that allows us to systematically augment an existing network architecture using constraints about its nodes by deterministically converting rules into differentiable computation graphs. To allow for the possibility of such rules being incorrect, our framework is designed to admit soft constraints from the ground up. Our framework is compatible with off-the-shelf neural networks without extensive redesign or any additional trainable parameters.

We evaluate our approach on three different NLP tasks: machine comprehension, textual entailment, and text chunking. We show that augmented models lead to large performance gains in the low training data regimes.1 2 Problem Setup In this section, we will introduce the notation and assumptions that form the basis of our formalism for constraining neural networks. Neural networks are directed acyclic computation graphs G = ( V,E ), consisting of nodes ( i.e. neurons ) V and weighted directed edges E that represent information flow. Although not all neurons have explicitly grounded meanings, some nodes indeed can be endowed with semantics tied to the task. Node semantics may be assigned during model design ( e.g. attention ), or incidentally discovered in post hoc analysis ( e.g., Le et al., 2012; Radford et al., 2017, and others ).

Note that such rules include Horn clauses and their generalizations, which are well studied in the knowledge representation and logic programming communities ( e.g. Chandra and Harel, 1985 ). Integrating rules with neural networks presents three difficulties. First, we need a mapping between the predicates in the rules and nodes in the computation graph. Second, logic is not differentiable; we need an encoding of logic that admits training using gradient based methods. Finally, computation graphs are acyclic, but user-defined rules may introduce cyclic dependencies between the nodes. Let us look at these issues in order.",

An implicative statement is acyclic if it is not cyclic. Fig. 2 and its caption gives examples of cyclic and acyclic implications. A cyclic statement sometimes can be converted to an equivalent acyclic statement by constructing its contrapositive. For example, the constraint B1 → A1 is equivalent to ¬A1 → ¬B1. While the former is cyclic, the later is acyclic. Generally, we can assume that we have acyclic implications.2 3 A Framework for Augmenting Neural Networks with Constraints To create constraint-aware neural networks, we will extend the computation graph of an existing network with additional edges defined by constraints.

The importance of the entire constraint is decided by a real-valued hyper-parameter ρ ≥ 0.

In all cases, recall that the zi’s are the states of neurons and are assumed to be in the range [0, 1]. Examining the table, we see that with a conjunctive antecedent ( first row ), the distance becomes zero if even one of the conjuncts is false. For a disjunctive antecedent ( second row ), the distance becomes zero only when all the disjuncts are false; otherwise, it increases as the disjuncts become more likely to be true.

In Eq. 1, the distance function serves to promote or inhibit the value of downstream neuron. The extent is controlled by the scaling factor ρ.

To be consistent in terminology, when considering biconditional statement ( ¬A ∨B )↔ P , we will call the auxiliary literal P the consequent, and the original literals A and B the antecedents.

Note that, compared to Eq. 1, we do not need activation function since the distance, which is in [0, 1], can be interpreted as producing normalized scores. Note that this construction only applies to auxiliary predicates in biconditional statements. The advantage of this layer definition is that we can use the same distance functions as before ( i.e., Table 1 ). Furthermore, the same design considerations in §3.1 still apply here, including how to negate the left and right hand sides. Constructing augmented networks. To complete the modeling framework, we summarize the workflow needed to construct an augmented neural network given a conditional statement and a computation graph: ( 1 ) Convert the antecedent into a conjunctive or a disjunctive normal form if necessary. ( 2 ) Convert the conjunctive/disjunctive antecedent into distance functions using Table 1 ( with appropriate corrections for negations ).

To explore the augmentation over such neurons , we focus on attention-based machine comprehension models on SQuAD ( v1.1 ) dataset ( Rajpurkar et al . , 2016 ) . We seek to use word relatedness from external resources ( i.e . , ConceptNet ) to guide alignments , and thus to improve model performance . Model. We base our framework on two models : BiDAF ( Seo et al . , 2017 ) and its ELMoaugmented variant ( Peters et al . , 2018 ) . Here, we provide an abstraction of the two models which our framework will operate on: where p and q are the paragraph and query respectively, σ refers to the softmax activation, ←−a and −→a are the bidirectional attentions from q to p and vice versa, y and z are the probabilities of answer boundaries. All other aspects are abstracted as encoder and layers. Augmentation. By construction of the attention neurons, we expect that related words should be aligned.

The ruleR2 is more conservative as it also depends on the unconstrained model decision. In both cases , since Ki , j does not map to a node in the network , we have to create a new node ki , j whose value is determined using ConceptNet , as illustrated in Fig . 3 .

        "input": "Extracting Symptoms and their Status from Clinical Conversations Abstract This paper describes novel models tailored for a new application, that of extracting the symptoms mentioned in clinical conversations along with their status. Lack of any publicly available corpus in this privacy-sensitive domain led us to develop our own corpus, consisting of about 3K conversations annotated by professional medical scribes. We propose two novel deep learning approaches to infer the symptom names and their status : ( 1 ) a new hierarchical span-attribute tagging ( SA-T ) model , trained using curriculum learning , and ( 2 ) a variant of sequence-to-sequence model which decodes the symptoms and their status from a few speaker turns within a sliding window over the conversation . This task stems from a realistic application of assisting medical providers in capturing symptoms mentioned by patients from their clinical conversations. To reflect this application, we define multiple metrics. From inter-rater agreement, we find that the task is inherently difficult. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several contrasting conditions and observe that the performance of the models range from an F-score of 0.5 to 0.8 depending on the condition . Our analysis not only reveals the inherent challenges of the task, but also provides useful directions to improve the models. 1 Introduction In recent years, hospitals and clinics across the United States have been coaxed and cajoled into adopting Electronic Health Records through public policies and insurance requirements. This has led to the unforeseen side-effect of placing a disproportionate burden of documentation on physicians, causing burnouts among them ( Wachter and Goldsmith, 2018; Xu, 2018 ). One study found that full-time primary care physicians spent about 4.5 hours of an 11-hour workday interacting with the clinical documentation systems, and yet were still unable to finish their documentations and had to spend an additional 1.4 hours after normal clinical hours ( Arndt et al., 2017 ).",

        "input": "Speech and natural language processing are now sufficiently mature that there has been considerable interest, both in academia and industry, to investigate how these technologies can be exploited to simplify the task of documentation, and to allow physicians to dedicate more time to patients. While domain-specific ASR systems that allow doctors to dictate notes have been around for a while, recent work ( Patel et al., 2018; Finley et al., 2018a,b ) has begun to address more challenging tasks, such as extracting relevant information directly from doctor-patient conversations. In this work, we investigated the task of inferring symptoms mentioned in clinical conversations, along with whether patients have experienced them or not. Our contributions include: ( i ) defining the task, including the annotation scheme for labeling the clinical conversations and the evaluation metrics to measure model performance ( Section 3 ); ( ii ) two novel deep learning models to solve this task ( Section 4 ); ( iii ) comprehensive empirical evaluations in different contrasting conditions ( Section 5 ), and ( iv ) analysis of the performance of the models that provides meaningful insights for further improvements ( Section 6 ). 2 Related Work On the topic of information extraction from medical text, one of the earliest public-domain task is the i2b2 challenge, defined on a small corpus of written discharge summaries that consists of 394 reports for training, 477 for test, and 877 for evaluation ( Uzuner et al., 2011 ). Given the small amount of training data, not surprisingly, a disproportionately large number of teams fielded rule-based systems. CRF-based systems however did better even with the limited amount of training data . Being a written domain task, they benefited from section headings and other cues that are unavailable in doctor-patient conversations. For a wider survey of extracting clinical information from written clinical documents, see ( Liu et al., 2012 ). There are very few publications on processing clinical conversations. One noteworthy recent work extracts entities using a multi-stage approach ( Finley et al., 2018a ).",

A few of the conversations also contain speech from nurses, caregivers, spouses and other attendees. The annotation guidelines were developed by a team of professional medical scribes, physicians and natural language processing experts. Two primary categories of labels were annotated: the symptoms being discussed and their status. An ontology of 186 symptoms were defined ( e.g., vomiting, nausea, diarrhea ), each belonging to one of 14 body systems ( e.g., gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular ). For each symptom, annotators were instructed to associate a status that denotes whether the patient has experienced it or not.",

The top three symptoms in the corpus are: musculo-skeletal pain, shortness of breath and cough. Of the 90K encounters, we chose to focus on primary care visits. A team of 18 professional scribes was trained on the guidelines. They labeled the manual transcripts of 2,950 conversations, which were partitioned into training ( 1,950 ), development ( 500 ) and test ( 500 ) sets.

        "input": "Further analyses showed that the low score was largely due to ( i ) the ambiguous and informal ways that patients and doctors discuss symptoms, ( ii ) that human scribes often disagree on which one of closely related labels to pick, and ( iii ) that human scribes often disagree on the span of text to label. 3.2 Evaluation Metrics In clinical conversations, the symptoms may be mentioned multiple times, paraphrased differently, but still may appear in the clinical notes only once. So, we chose to evaluate them at the conversation levels using two metrics. Unweighted metric: In this metric, we account only for the unique symptoms and ignore the number of times they were mentioned. The set of events in the inferred output was compared against the set in the reference to compute the precision and recall for each conversation before averaging across all conversations . Weighted metric: The symptoms that are mentioned more often in a conversation are likely to be more important. In this metric , each symptom is weighted by its frequency : precision is weighted by the frequency of the predictions , while recall is weighted by the frequency of the reference . 4 Models We developed two novel neural network model architectures for this task : 1 ) a span-attribute model that is similar in spirit to a tagging model but works well on our large label space , and 2 ) a sequence-to-sequence ( Seq2Seq ) model ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ; Cho et al . , 2014 ) that is designed to infer symptoms that are described informally across a few conversation turns . 4.1 Span-Attribute Tagging ( SA-T ) Model A common solution for this task is a tagging model , where the word sequences are represented by word and / or character embeddings and fed into a sequence of layers consisting of a bidirectional layer , a softmax layer and a conditional random field ( CRF ) to predict the BIO-style tags ( Collobert et al . , 2011 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ; Ma and Hovy , 2016 ; Chiu and Nichols , 2016 ; Lample et al . , 2016 ; Peters et al . , 2017 ; Yang et al . , 2017 ; Changpinyo et al . , 2018 ) . However, in our task, the tags need to identify not only the symptom names associated with the words but also the status. This can be accomplished in a tagging model using a label space that is the Cartesian product of both the symptom names and their status. Unfortunately, this Cartesian space turns out to quite large in our task ( 186 x 3 ). Tagging models perform well when the set of tags is reasonably small ( e.g., named entity recognition and part of speech tagging ), but not so well when the set of tags is large.",

        "input": "Moreover, in our case, given the limited corpus size, modeling the cross-product space leads to data sparsity. For tackling this challenge of data sparsity, we reformulate the problem from a novel hierarchical perspective. Unlike the conventional tagging model, where at each input token the model has to pick the best candidate label from the full label space, we break this into two stages. We first identify the span of interest using a generic tag set with a very small label set of just three elements, {sym B, sym I, O}. This simplifies the computational cost of inferring over sequence , which allows us to employ the CRF layer . Moreover, it alleviates the data sparsity problem by pooling all the labels to identify all spans of interest. In the second stage, we predict the attributes associated with the span using contextual features of arbitrary complexity without encumbering the inference over the entire sequence. In addition, since our label space can be partitioned easily, we use two separate predictors, one for symptom name and one for status. These two stages are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion using multi-task learning, as described later. Figure 1 illustrates this hierarchical perspective for our task.",

The two stages of the model are described in more details below. Span Extraction Layer.

        "input": "Remarks. Although the SA-T model was developed to infer symptoms and status in the clinical domain , the formulation is general and can be applied to any domain . The SA-T model breaks up the task into identifying spans of interests and then classifying the span with richer contextual representations . The first stage alleviates data sparsity by pooling all spans of interest. When the label space naturally partitions into separate categories, the second stage can be broken up further into separate prediction tasks and reduces data splitting. 4.2 Sequence-to-sequence ( Seq2Seq ) Model As shown in Table 1, symptoms are sometimes not stated explicitly, but rather explained or described in informal language over several conversation turns. There may not even be a symptom entity that is explicitly mentioned; instead, the physician, as well as any symptom extraction model, must infer it from a description. To better capture symptoms that are not referred to by name, we explore an alternative formulation of the problem. In this formulation, the input to the model is a chunk of the conversation, consisting of multiple consecutive turns from the doctor-patient conversation, and the output is a list of symptoms mentioned as well as their statuses. The key difference between this formulation and the span-attribute tagging formulation is that the symptom entity is not assigned to a word or phrase in the input text. In this formulation, each input example consists of a segment of transcript, represented as a sequence of tokens x = ( x1, ..., xm ), and a list of symptoms and their corresponding status y = ( y1, ..., yn ).",

Following the standard Seq2Seq setup , our model is composed of two recurrent neural networks ( RNNs ) , an encoder and a decoder . First, the encoder consumes x one token at a time, producing an encoding, h( xi ), for each token xi. Then the decoder estimates an output distribution over sequences of symptoms and their status y, conditional on the encodings. An attention mechanism ( Bahdanau et al . , 2015 ) allows the decoder to combine information from the encoded sequences differently at each decoding step . The Seq2Seq model is trained using a cross-entropy criterion to maximize P ( y | x ) – the likelihood of reference symptoms and their status given the conversation transcripts . At inference time, the most likely sequence of symptoms and their status is decoded one token a time using beam search. One challenge for Seq2Seq models is handling very long inputs ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , unlike the span-attribute tagging model where each input example may be a full transcript , we use transcript segments consisting of k consecutive turns .

At any given input time, the conversation up to that time is represented by the hidden state of the encoder, which is used for making output predictions. We investigated two variations of the encoder. First , we compare the LSTM encoder with the Transformer encoder ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) . The key difference between them is that the LSTM relies on latent variables to propagate state information while Transformer relies solely on an attention mechanism . In a machine translation benchmark , the Transformer has been shown to outperform the LSTM encoder ( Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) , and a hybrid model , consisting of a Transformer encoder and an LSTM decoder , performed even better ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . We therefore compare the hybrid model , with the LSTM-only encoder-decoder model on our task . Second, we use a pre-training technique to leverage unlabeled data and improve the feature representation learned by the encoder ( Kannan et al., 2018 ).

While a few of these tools can annotate symptom entities with some accuracy , they have no mechanism to infer the symptom status , which is required for clinical documentation .

The model outputs were compared against the above mentioned variants of the reference and the results are reported in Table 7. The measured gap in performance between single reference and “voted” reference is small. The “voted” version corrects the reference, when one of the three scribes misses the annotation. However, when two scribes pick different valid labels and the third misses them, the “voted” reference is not better than the single reference. In such instances, allowing a model to match “any” of the references would be a reasonable solution. This may explain why the performance in that case is substantially better than the single or “voted” reference. 5.4 ASR vs. Manual Transcript Evaluation In clinical applications, manual transcripts will be unavailable and the model needs to infer symptom and status on transcripts obtained from an automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) system. We investigated the impact on performance when the test data is switched from manual to the corresponding ASR transcripts.

        "input": "So, we measured performance using models trained on different combinations of manual and ASR transcripts. Recall, the symptom, as described in Section 3.1, were annotated on manual transcripts. These annotations were automatically transferred to the ASR transcripts by aligning the words in both transcripts for the same speaker turns and mapping the labels from manual transcripts to the corresponding words in the ASR transcripts. The word error rate of the ASR transcripts is about 20% ( Chiu et al., 2018 ). In the alignment process, a fraction of the labels ( 9.1% ) failed to alignment properly and were discarded. The results, reported in Table 8 with “voted” reference, show that the performance of the models trained on manual transcripts ( Manual Train ) degraded when tested on ASR transcripts ( ASR Test ), for both models, as expected. But, surprisingly, training models on ASR transcripts ( ASR Train ) or folding the ASR transcripts into the manual training data ( Combined ) did not improve the performance much. This maybe due to the fact that our performance metrics are evaluated at the conversation level and there is redundancy in clinical conversations, where the same symptom may be mentioned multiple times during the course of the conversation and each time in a different way. 5.5 Symptom Names vs. Body Systems One way to understand the confusion between symptom names is to measure the performance after projecting the inferred symptom names ( 186 types ) to their corresponding body systems ( 14 types ).

        "input": "First, even humans have difficulty identifying symptoms consistently. For example, “constitutional pain” ( non-specific ) and “musculoskeletal pain” were top confusions for our models as well as humans. Second , when status is considered , humans have less trouble inferring it from the context than our models , losing only 0.05 on F1 ( weighted ) , while our models dropped about 0.14 . Improving status classification remains one of our future work. 6.2 Attention Weights Next , we inspected the Seq2Seq model ’ s attention weights to see whether the evidence is scattered across words and turns in the dialog . Indeed, through manual inspection, we found this to be true qualitatively, as illustrated in Table 11. In this example, the symptom “sym:const:difficulty sleeping” is not mentioned directly but is implied from the evidence scattered in the context. Future work could use these weights to further investigate errors. 6.3 Error Analysis Grouping false negatives by their symptom name, we observed that both models struggled with the symptoms – pain, malaise, fatigue, difficult sleeping, weight loss/gain, and frequent urination. As illustrated in Table 12, these symptoms were often communicated through back-and-forth with the doctor and therefore may have required combining evidence from multiple turns, making the inference more difficult. 7 Conclusions This paper describes a novel information extraction task, that of extracting the symptoms mentioned in clinical conversations along with their status. We describe our corpus, the annotation paradigm, and tailored evaluation metrics. We proposed a novel span-attribute tagging ( SAT ) model and a variant of sequence-to-sequence model to solve the problem .",

        "input": "The SA-T model breaks up the task into identifying spans of interests and then classifying the span with richer contextual representations. The first stage alleviates data sparsity by pooling all spans of interest. When the label space naturally partitions into separate categories, the second stage can be broken up further into separate prediction tasks and reduces data splitting. Although the SA-T model was developed to infer symptoms and status in the clinical domain, the formulation is general and can be applied to any domain. As an alternative , our Seq2Seq model is designed to infer symptom labels when the evidence is scattered across multiple turns in a dialog and is not easily associated with a specific word span . The performance of our models is significantly better than baseline systems and range from an F-score of 0.5 to 0.8 depending on the condition . When the models are trained on manual transcripts and applied on ASR transcripts, the performance degrades considerably compared to applying them on manual transcripts. Training the model on ASR transcripts or on both ASR and manual transcripts does not help bridge the performance gap. Our analysis show that the SA-T model has higher precision while Seq2Seq model has higher recall , thus the two models compliment each other . We plan to investigate the impact of combining the two models.",
